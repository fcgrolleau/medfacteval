Presence of important facts\\n\\n**Score: 54/100** (95% CI: 44-64) (higher values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the important facts missing:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries frequently omit critical clinical facts due to recurring patterns: (1) **Procedural/device omissions**, where specific interventions (e.g., JP drains in Patient 0, adhesion takedown in Patient 2) are excluded despite documenting related surgeries; (2) **Unlinked diagnoses**, where coexisting findings (e.g., Patient 3’s chest pain and port thrombus) are described separately without causal attribution; (3) **Incomplete medication documentation**, including dose changes (Patient 6’s insulin switch from Lantus to Levemir) or therapy rationale (Patient 9’s finasteride for UTI prevention); (4) **Absence of explicit descriptors**, such as \"compensated\" cirrhosis (Patient 10) or \"neoadjuvant chemotherapy\" (Patient 7); (5) **Inadequate follow-up specificity**, omitting timelines (Patient 12’s TPN) or monitoring frequency (Patient 20’s CBCs); (6) **Underreported acute events**, like Patient 13’s panic attack or Patient 28’s sepsis components; and (7) **Partial test result reporting**, such as negative imaging findings without clinical correlation (Patient 26’s SMA stenosis). These patterns highlight systemic gaps in synthesizing procedural details, causal relationships, and contextualizing diagnostic/therapeutic decisions.\\n\\n### B. Hospital course summaries contradicting important facts\\n\\n**Score: 16/100** (95% CI: 10-24) (lower values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the inconsistencies:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries often exhibit inconsistencies with clinical facts due to recurring patterns: **1) Procedural/diagnostic timing conflicts** (e.g., Patient 4’s outpatient GI biopsy described as completed vs. \"planned EUS/FNA\" post-admission); **2) Medication discrepancies** (Patient 6’s insulin listed as Lantus 15U BID in facts vs. Levemir 16U BID in summary); **3) Etiological misattribution** (Patient 6’s adrenal crisis attributed to prednisone intolerance vs. vomiting/non-absorption in the summary); **4) Contradictory clinical status** (Patient 18’s \"persistent fever\" in facts vs. resolved fever in summary); **5) Microbiological mismatches** (Patient 19’s reported polymicrobial UTI vs. only *E. faecalis* documented); **6) Omission of key details** (Patient 28’s urinary retention and sepsis management absent from the summary); and **7) Misalignment in diagnosis attribution** (Patient 15’s discharge diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis vs. AKI in the summary). These inconsistencies stem from documentation errors (e.g., Patient 26’s metoprolol dosing frequency discrepancy [75mg BID vs. 150mg daily split q6h]), misinterpretation of causation (Patient 22’s cholangitis attributed to drain malfunction vs. post-procedural complication), and incomplete data integration (Patient 8’s omitted aspiration event and conflicting GPC speciation status). Such patterns highlight risks of miscommunication and clinical decision-making errors.\\n\\n## Detailed results\\n\\n### A.

All Missing Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 0, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left-sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the detailed hospital course summary in both Format 1 and Format 2, there is no explicit mention of a left sided abdominal JP drain or any drain being left in place at discharge. While the summary includes extensive details about the Whipple procedure, post operative care, medications, and various aspects of the patient\\'s recovery, it does not mention any surgical drains. The summary covers many post operative details including pain management, nutritional status, bowel movements, and medications, but is silent on the specific fact of a JP drain. Even in sections discussing post operative care and discharge planning, there is no reference to drain management or presence.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, surgical procedure (Whipple procedure), and post operative care. It outlines various problems the patient faced, including duodenal adenocarcinoma, anemia, bloating, pain management, nausea, nutritional deficiency, and constipation. The summary discusses the patient\\'s condition at discharge, mentioning that the patient was recovering as expected postoperatively. However, upon reviewing the provided summary, there is no explicit mention of a \\'Left sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge.\\' The summary does discuss post operative care and management but does not specify the presence or absence of a JP drain.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed in both standard and problem based formats. Key sections reviewed include \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed,\\' \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge,\\' and discharge plans across all problem categories. While the Whipple procedure and post operative care details (e.g., pain management, nutrition, medications) are explicitly documented, there is no mention of a left sided abdominal JP drain in any context. The summary does not reference drains, surgical devices, or wound care devices remaining at discharge, either directly (e.g., \\'JP drain\\') or via synonyms (e.g., \\'surgical drain\\'). The absence persists across all procedural, medication, and discharge planning documentation.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 2, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed. Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, while it mentions that a laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed on May 19, 2023, it does not explicitly mention the specific surgical details about taking down adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall or removing obstructing necrotic mass. The summary only provides general information about the procedure being performed (\\'laparoscopic small bowel resection performed on May 19, 2023, with primary anastomosis\\') without the specific intraoperative details requested. While we know there was a necrotic mass (mentioned in the CT findings and diagnosis sections), the specific surgical steps of dealing with adhesions and removing the mass are not explicitly detailed in this summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly states \\'Laparoscopic small bowel resection performed on May 19, 2023, with primary anastomosis\\' under Therapeutic Procedures Performed. This matches the second part of the fact (\\'Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\'). 2. The summary also mentions \\'necrotic small bowel mass\\' in the Primary Diagnosis and describes its resection in the surgical procedure, addressing the \\'obstructing necrotic mass were removed\\' component. 3. However, there is no mention of adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall being taken down in any section of the summary. While prior surgeries are documented, the specific adhesion takedown procedure is not described. 4. Since the fact requires both components (adhesion takedown AND obstructing mass removal with resection/anastomosis), and only the latter is explicitly documented, the full fact is not completely stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 2, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient recovered from surgery well; had flatus and bowel movement \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing both the standard section based summary and problem based summary, there is no explicit mention of the patient having flatus or bowel movement post surgery. While the summary includes detailed information about the surgical procedure (laparoscopic small bowel resection) and mentions that the patient was stable for discharge, it does not specifically document return of bowel function. The closest related information is in section 9, which notes the patient was \\'stable for discharge\\' and had \\'no nausea or vomiting,\\' and mentions medications for bowel management (MiraLAX, senna). However, these do not explicitly confirm the occurrence of flatus or bowel movement. Given the importance of return of bowel function post surgery, this would likely have been documented if it occurred, but we can only evaluate what is explicitly stated in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s recovery and condition post surgery. Under \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge,\\' it is stated that the patient was stable for discharge with well controlled pain, no nausea or vomiting, and improving anemia. However, it does not explicitly mention \\'flatus\\' or \\'bowel movement.\\' The closest related information is the management of nausea and bowel with medications like MiraLAX and senna, indicating some attention to bowel function, but this is not the same as stating the patient had flatus or a bowel movement. Thus, the specific fact of having flatus and bowel movement is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) Reviewed \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge\\' which states \\'stable post surgery\\' with \\'no nausea/vomiting\\' but does not mention bowel function. 2) Checked \\'MiraLAX/senna\\' in medications which indicates bowel regimen use but does not confirm successful flatus/BM. 3) Scanned all problem based sections (including GI related Problem #2 and #6) which describe resection and nutritional support but lack explicit documentation of bowel recovery milestones. 4) Confirmed that while clinical stability and bowel management are noted, the specific endpoints of flatus and bowel movement are not explicitly stated in either format of the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 3, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** LLQ abdominal pain 2/2 cancer\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states in the \\'Reason for Admission\\' that the patient was admitted for \\'recurrent left lower quadrant (LLQ) abdominal pain.\\' The patient\\'s primary diagnosis is stage IV sigmoid adenocarcinoma with metastases, and the LLQ pain is listed in the context of this cancer diagnosis. However, the summary does not explicitly state that the LLQ pain is directly attributed to cancer (e.g., \\'LLQ pain secondary to cancer\\' or equivalent phrasing). While the cancer and LLQ pain are both mentioned, causality is implied but not explicitly declared. The guidelines specify that paraphrased or synonymous statements are acceptable, but here the causal link (e.g., \\'2/2 cancer\\') is not clearly articulated, even though the clinical context strongly suggests it. Thus, the fact is not explicitly mentioned as required.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 3, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** R-sided chest pain 2/2 port-associated thrombus\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact \\'R sided chest pain 2/2 port associated thrombus\\' requires two components to be explicitly linked: 1) right sided chest pain and 2) a causal relationship with port thrombus. Analyzing the text: 1. Right sided chest pain is explicitly mentioned in multiple places: \\'admitted for right sided chest pain\\' in Reason for Admission Under Problem #1: Chest Pain 2. Port thrombus is also explicitly mentioned: \\'Small non occlusive thrombus around the port catheter\\' in Secondary Diagnoses Problem #2: Port Thrombus However, while both components are present, the text never explicitly states or implies that the chest pain was caused by (\\'2/2\\' or \\'secondary to\\') the port thrombus. These are presented as separate findings without a stated causal relationship.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions both components of the fact but does not explicitly link them. The \\'Reason for Admission\\' states the patient had right sided chest pain, and under \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\' and \\'Problem #2: Port Thrombus\\', a small non occlusive thrombus around the port catheter is documented. However, there is no explicit statement in the text indicating that the right sided chest pain was attributed to (2/2) the port associated thrombus. The two findings are presented as separate clinical issues without a documented causal relationship. While both elements of the fact are present, the required causal link (2/2) is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 4, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pancreatic tail mass leading to outpatient GI biopsy\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I find that while a pancreatic tail mass is clearly mentioned and extensively discussed, there is no explicit mention of an outpatient GI biopsy. The summary indicates that an EUS/FNA (Endoscopic Ultrasound with Fine Needle Aspiration) is PLANNED, as noted in section 7 \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' and in the Problem Based Summary under Problem #1, but this is described as a future plan rather than a completed outpatient procedure. The mass is described as being newly discovered (\\'incidentally found during evaluation for urinary retention\\') and the workup appears to be in its initial stages with plans for future biopsy rather than following up on an outpatient biopsy. The diagnostic information about the mass comes from CT and MRI imaging performed during this admission, not from a prior outpatient biopsy.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s admission for an expedited oncology workup of a pancreatic tail mass. The summary explicitly mentions the discovery of a 2 cm pancreatic tail mass and subsequent plans for further evaluation, including EUS/FNA and surgical consultation. However, it does not mention an outpatient GI biopsy. The closest relevant information is the plan for EUS/FNA, which is a diagnostic procedure related to the pancreatic mass. Since \\'outpatient GI biopsy\\' is not explicitly mentioned, we need to determine if EUS/FNA can be considered equivalent. EUS/FNA is a specific procedure that involves biopsy, but the summary does not specify that it is to be done on an outpatient basis. Thus, while related, it is not a direct match for \\'outpatient GI biopsy\\'. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, the specific fact about adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune polyglandular syndrome is clearly mentioned, but the component about \\'likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone\\' is not explicitly stated. Here\\'s the analysis: 1. The summary confirms adrenal crisis (mentioned in Reason for Admission and Primary Diagnosis) 2. Primary adrenal insufficiency is confirmed as part of APS Type 2 (mentioned in Relevant Medical History) 3. Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome is explicitly mentioned multiple times 4. However, the summary attributes the adrenal crisis to \\'vomiting and possibly inadequate stress dosing of steroids\\' rather than PO prednisone intolerance 5. While the patient was on Prednisone (2.5 mg BID), the summary doesn\\'t mention any intolerance to it as a cause of the crisis\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course explicitly mentions adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS Type 2). However, the summary attributes the crisis to \\'vomiting and possibly inadequate stress dosing of steroids\\' rather than \\'intolerance of PO prednisone.\\' While the patient was on PO prednisone, the text does not state that intolerance to oral prednisone (e.g., malabsorption, refusal, or inability to tolerate oral intake) was a contributing factor. The crisis is instead linked to vomiting (implying inability to retain oral medications) and insufficient steroid dosing during stress. Since the specific term \\'intolerance of PO prednisone\\' or an equivalent phrase is absent, the fact is not explicitly stated as per the criteria.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** While the summary mentions Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) as part of the patient\\'s medical history and discusses insulin management, it does not specifically mention changing insulin to Lantus 15 units twice a day. Instead, the summary states that the patient was \\'Started Levemir 16 UNITS BID and Insulin 1:7 TID AC\\'. Levemir is a different long acting insulin than Lantus, and the dosing mentioned (16 units BID) is different from the fact we\\'re looking for (Lantus 15 units twice a day). The patient did receive insulin therapy, including a transition from an insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin, but the specific regimen mentioned in the fact is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s admission and treatment for adrenal crisis and other related issues. Under \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\', it is mentioned that the patient was started on an \\'insulin drip for glucose control, transitioned to subQ insulin\\'. Further details on the specific insulin regimen are found under \\'Medications\\', where it is stated that the patient was started on \\'Levemir 16 UNITS BID and Insulin 1:7 TID AC\\'. There is no mention of \\'Lantus\\' or an insulin regimen of \\'15units twice a day\\'. Lantus and Levemir are both long acting insulins, but they are not the same; Lantus is insulin glargine, while Levemir is insulin detemir. Therefore, the specific fact \\'Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states under \\'Medications\\' that the patient was started on \\'Levemir 16 UNITS BID\\' and \\'Insulin 1:7 TID AC\\'. While Levemir (insulin detemir) and Lantus (insulin glargine) are both long acting insulins, they are distinct formulations. The summary explicitly mentions Levemir at 16 units BID, not Lantus at 15 units BID. The dose (16 vs. 15) and specific insulin type (Levemir vs. Lantus) differ from the fact being queried. No other sections mention Lantus or a 15 unit BID regimen. While the insulin regimen was changed, the exact formulation and dose specified in the fact are not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 6, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Vitamin D deficiency, started on replacement, fat soluble vitamins sent, need to follow-up \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that vitamin D deficiency and replacement therapy are partially mentioned. In section 8 (Medications), it states \\'Vitamin D 50,000 IU q7 x4\\' was prescribed, indicating vitamin D replacement therapy was initiated. However, the summary does not explicitly mention a vitamin D deficiency diagnosis, does not mention fat soluble vitamin testing being sent, and does not specifically mention the need for vitamin D follow up. Since only one component (vitamin D replacement) is mentioned without the other required elements (explicit mention of deficiency, fat soluble vitamins being sent, and follow up needs), this does not constitute a complete match for the fact being sought.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient was started on Vitamin D 50,000 IU weekly for 4 doses under the \\'Medications\\' section, which constitutes replacement therapy for deficiency. However, the summary does not explicitly state a diagnosis of \\'Vitamin D deficiency\\' (though replacement implies it), does not mention sending other fat soluble vitamins (A, E, K) beyond Vitamin D, and does not specify follow up for Vitamin D (only general endocrinology follow up). While Vitamin D replacement is clearly documented, the other components of the fact (explicit deficiency labeling, other fat soluble vitamins, and Vitamin D specific follow up) are absent. A busy physician would likely recognize the replacement as addressing deficiency but might note missing documentation of the full fact chain.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 7, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left renal cell carcinoma status-post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post-op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary step by step: 1. First, I found clear mention of left renal cell carcinoma in multiple places, including the \\'Reason for Admission\\' and \\'Primary Diagnosis\\' sections. 2. The surgical intervention (left nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy) is explicitly mentioned in both Format 1 and Format 2 sections. 3. However, while the summary discusses the current post operative state and surgical intervention, there is no explicit mention of neoadjuvant chemotherapy anywhere in the text. 4. The summary moves directly from the patient\\'s diagnosis to surgical intervention without mentioning any pre surgical chemotherapy treatment. 5. Since neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a significant part of the fact we\\'re looking for and it\\'s not mentioned anywhere in the summary, even though the other components (RCC, nephrectomy, and IVC thrombectomy) are present, we must conclude the complete fact is not fully present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient has a history of left renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with associated tumor thrombus in the inferior vena cava (IVC) and underwent left nephrectomy and removal of tumor thrombus from IVC. The summary is divided into sections that clearly state the patient\\'s history, primary diagnosis, and the surgical procedures performed. The \\'Reason for Admission\\' section mentions the patient\\'s history of left RCC and associated IVC tumor thrombus. The \\'Primary Diagnosis\\' section confirms the diagnosis of malignant neoplasm of the kidney, left (RCC with IVC tumor thrombus). The \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' section lists left nephrectomy and removal of tumor thrombus from IVC. The problem based summary further reinforces this information under \\'Problem #1: Malignant Neoplasm of Kidney, Left (RCC)\\' by stating the patient\\'s postoperative status after left nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy. Therefore, the fact that the patient had left renal cell carcinoma status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy is partially mentioned, but it does not explicitly state the \\'status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\'. However, the key elements of left renal cell carcinoma, left nephrectomy, and IVC thrombectomy are explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions the patient\\'s left renal cell carcinoma (RCC), left nephrectomy, and IVC thrombectomy in multiple sections (e.g., \\'Reason for Admission,\\' \\'Primary Diagnosis,\\' \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed,\\' and Problem #1). However, there is no mention of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in any part of the summary. The text describes the patient\\'s surgical history, postoperative course, and current management but does not reference chemotherapy administered prior to surgery. Since the neoadjuvant chemotherapy component of the fact is absent, the full fact as stated is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 7, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second-line\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed both the standard section based summary and problem based summary sections of the hospital course, looking for any mention of: 1. Hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo (ipilimumab/nivolumab) 2. Switch to cabozantinib as second line therapy Key findings: The summary mentions the patient has renal cell carcinoma No mention of any immunotherapy treatments (ipi/nivo) No mention of hypersensitivity reactions No mention of cabozantinib No mention of any changes in cancer therapy The summary focuses on the surgical management of RCC (nephrectomy) and post operative course, but does not discuss any systemic cancer treatments or medication changes related to cancer therapy.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention a hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo or a switch to cabozantinib as a second line treatment. The summary focuses on the patient\\'s postoperative care following left nephrectomy and removal of tumor thrombus from the IVC, detailing the management of postoperative complications such as hypotension, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, acute kidney injury, and hypoactive delirium. The medications section lists various drugs the patient was on or was started on during hospitalization, but there is no mention of ipi/nivo (ipilimumab/nivolumab) or cabozantinib.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed in detail. Key sections reviewed include Medications, Therapeutic Procedures, and Problem Based Summaries. There is no mention of ipilimumab (ipi) or nivolumab (nivo) in the medication list, treatment history, or problem lists. The summary does not describe any adverse drug reactions, hypersensitivity events, or treatment changes related to these agents. Elevated liver enzymes are noted but attributed to postoperative status without reference to immunotherapy toxicity. Cabozantinib is not mentioned in any context. The oncologic follow up plan is generic, with no specific second line therapy documented. The absence of these key elements indicates the fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 8, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Down\\'s syndrome, neurogenic bladder, admitted for pneumonia, treated with CAP regimen and vancomycin due to positive sputum culture for MRSA\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Down\\'s syndrome is explicitly mentioned in the \\'Reason for Admission\\' and \\'Relevant Medical History\\' sections. 2. Neurogenic bladder is clearly listed under \\'Relevant Medical History\\'. 3. Admission for pneumonia is documented as the primary diagnosis (CAP). 4. CAP regimen (CTX + Azithromycin) and vancomycin use are both described in therapeutic procedures. However, while vancomycin initiation is linked to MRSA nares positivity and potential S. aureus pneumonia, the summary does NOT explicitly state that the sputum culture itself was positive for MRSA. The sputum culture showed \\'rare to small number Staph aureus\\' without specifying MRSA, and MRSA colonization was identified via nares swab. Since the fact specifically requires \\'positive sputum culture for MRSA\\' as the reason for vancomycin, this critical link is missing despite clinical context suggesting MRSA coverage.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find any mention of: 1) An aspiration event prior to discharge, 2) Blood culture results showing 1/4 bottles positive for GPC (Gram positive cocci), or 3) Pending speciation results at discharge. The summary does mention blood cultures were pending during the hospital stay, but does not provide the specific detail about 1/4 bottles being positive for GPC. While there are mentions of MRSA colonization and S. aureus in sputum and urine cultures, there is no explicit mention of blood culture results or an aspiration event. The conclusion section indicates the patient was discharged without noting these specific findings. The only culture results explicitly mentioned are: MRSA nares (positive), sputum (small number Staph aureus), and urine (50k S. Aureus and 7k enteric GNR).\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, there is no mention of a potential aspiration event, the number of bottles positive for GPC, or the status of speciation. The summary discusses the patient\\'s treatment for community acquired pneumonia, acute kidney injury, urinary tract infection, and MRSA colonization, but does not reference any aspiration event or blood culture results related to GPC. Therefore, the fact is not mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) The \\'Potential aspiration event prior to discharge\\' component: While the patient has dysphagia with a G tube (a risk factor for aspiration), there is no explicit mention of an aspiration event occurring near discharge. The pneumonia is labeled as community acquired without reference to aspiration etiology. 2) \\'1/4 bottles positive for GPC\\': The summary references sputum cultures with Staph aureus (a GPC) but does not mention blood culture bottles or a 1/4 positivity rate. Blood cultures are noted as \\'pending,\\' not positive. 3) \\'Speciation not complete by discharge\\': While blood culture results were pending, there is no specific link to incomplete speciation of GPC positive bottles. None of the three key elements of the fact are explicitly stated or clearly implied in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 8, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Neurogenic bladder, high risk of UTI\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'neurogenic bladder\\' under \\'Relevant Medical History\\' and in the \\'Chronic Conditions\\' section of the problem based summary. 2. The summary documents a resolved urinary tract infection (UTI) and ongoing straight catheterization (4x/day), which are risk factors for UTIs. However, the phrase \\'high risk of UTI\\' or an equivalent explicit statement about UTI risk (e.g., \\'predisposition to UTIs\\') is not present. While neurogenic bladder and catheterization inherently increase UTI risk, the text does not state the risk itself as a distinct clinical consideration. 3. The guidelines specify that 0 should be used if the fact (or a plainly equivalent phrase) is absent, even if supporting evidence exists. Thus, while components of the fact are present, the explicit mention of \\'high risk of UTI\\' is missing.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze this step by step: 1. The summary mentions sepsis from urinary source: Confirms \\'sepsis due to UTI\\' in Secondary Diagnoses Confirms \\'complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) with possible developing pyelonephritis\\' as Primary Diagnosis 2. Regarding the 7 day course of cipro: The summary does NOT explicitly mention Cipro or a 7 day antibiotic course It mentions Zosyn and Vancomycin during hospitalization but doesn\\'t specify discharge antibiotics 3. Regarding finasteride: The summary DOES confirm starting finasteride: \\'Started finasteride 5 mg PO qHS for prostatomegaly\\' However, it does NOT explicitly state this was to prevent future UTIs Since all components of the fact (7 day Cipro course and finasteride specifically for UTI prevention) are not explicitly mentioned, this must be marked as not present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient was diagnosed with a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) with possible developing pyelonephritis and sepsis due to UTI. The patient was treated with antibiotics, and his condition improved. The summary also mentions that the patient was started on finasteride 5 mg PO qHS for prostatomegaly. However, it does not explicitly state that the patient was finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge. The antibiotics mentioned are Zosyn and Vancomycin, not cipro. Therefore, the specific fact about finishing a 7 day course of cipro is not mentioned. The fact that finasteride was started is mentioned, aligning with the attempt to prevent future UTIs as it was started for prostatomegaly.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis: Explicitly stated in both the Primary Diagnosis (\\'complicated UTI with possible developing pyelonephritis\\') and Secondary Diagnoses (\\'sepsis due to UTI\\'). The terms align with the fact\\'s wording. 2. 7 day cipro course on discharge: Not mentioned. The summary documents Zosyn and vancomycin use during hospitalization but does not specify ciprofloxacin at discharge or a 7 day duration. 3. Finasteride for UTI prevention: While finasteride initiation is documented, the stated reason is \\'prostatomegaly\\' rather than UTI prevention. The clinical intent differs from the fact\\'s claim. Since two of three critical components are absent (cipro course and indication for finasteride), the fact as a whole is not fully present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 9, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Possible normal pressure  hydrocephalus detected on CT head, follow-up appointment with neurologist outpatient. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact about normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and neurologist follow up is partially mentioned in the summary. Let\\'s break down the analysis: 1. NPH detection on CT: Yes, this is explicitly mentioned in multiple places: Under \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\': \\'possible normal pressure hydrocephalus\\' Under \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\': \\'CT Head without IV contrast suggested possible normal pressure hydrocephalus\\' Problem #4 specifically addresses \\'Possible Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus\\' 2. Follow up with neurologist: The summary mentions \\'Follow up with neurology if symptoms persist\\' under Problem #3, but this is conditional and not definitively scheduled. The Problem #4 section mentions \\'Clinical follow up\\' but doesn\\'t specifically state it\\'s with a neurologist. Since the fact requires both NPH detection AND a definitive neurologist follow up appointment, and only the NPH detection is clearly documented while the neurology follow up is conditional, we cannot say the complete fact is explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 9, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling, DVT US negative, unclear etiology \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary step by step looking for mentions of extremity swelling and DVT ultrasound results: 1. Found in section 6 \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\': \\'US for DVT was negative in both lower and upper extremities\\' 2. However, while the DVT ultrasound being negative is mentioned, there is no explicit mention of right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling specifically 3. The summary does not mention the unclear etiology of swelling 4. While a DVT ultrasound was performed (suggesting there may have been swelling that prompted the test), the actual presence of swelling is not explicitly stated in the text 5. Without explicit documentation of the swelling itself, even though related testing was done, we cannot consider this fact as fully present in the summary\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that \\'US for DVT was negative in both lower and upper extremities.\\' This directly relates to the fact in question, which involves swelling in the right upper extremity and left lower extremity, and a negative DVT US. Although the summary does not explicitly mention swelling in these extremities, it does confirm that a DVT ultrasound was performed and was negative for both upper and lower extremities. The presence of swelling is not directly stated but the negative DVT US result is explicitly mentioned, fulfilling part of the fact. However, the etiology of the swelling is not clearly explained in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states that a DVT ultrasound (US) was negative in both lower and upper extremities. However, there is no mention of right upper extremity or left lower extremity swelling in any section of the summary. The DVT US result is documented, but the clinical indication for the US (e.g., swelling) is not specified. Since the fact requires both the presence of swelling in specific extremities AND the negative DVT US with unclear etiology, and only the DVT US result is mentioned, the fact as a whole is not fully addressed.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 10, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** The patient also was found to have cirrhosis of the liver but has compensated disease \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The hospital course summary does mention cirrhosis, but does not explicitly state whether it is compensated or decompensated. Specifically, in section 6 \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\', it states \\'A bedside ultrasound showed a cirrhotic liver morphology without intrahepatic biliary duct dilation.\\' While there are some indicators that might suggest compensated disease (such as relatively mild liver enzyme elevations and the patient being clinically stable), the summary does not explicitly state that the cirrhosis is compensated. Therefore, while cirrhosis is mentioned, the specific fact about it being compensated disease is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that a bedside ultrasound showed a cirrhotic liver morphology, indicating the presence of cirrhosis. Additionally, the summary lists \\'mixed or cholestatic liver injury\\' as a secondary diagnosis and discusses the patient\\'s liver condition under Problem #4, indicating that the patient has liver disease. However, the summary does not explicitly state that the patient has \\'compensated cirrhosis.\\' Compensated cirrhosis implies that the cirrhosis is present without significant liver dysfunction or decompensation. While the patient\\'s liver enzymes improved during the hospital stay and there is no mention of significant liver decompensation (e.g., variceal bleeding, ascites, or hepatic encephalopathy), the fact that the cirrhosis is compensated is not directly stated. Nonetheless, the presence of cirrhosis is acknowledged, and the lack of mention of decompensation symptoms could imply compensation. Still, the explicit statement of \\'compensated disease\\' is not present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'cirrhotic liver morphology\\' in the diagnostic investigations via bedside ultrasound, confirming cirrhosis. However, the term \\'compensated disease\\' is not used. While the summary notes stable liver enzyme improvement and no biliary dilation (suggesting absence of acute complications), the specific descriptor \\'compensated\\' is absent. The guidelines require explicit mention of the fact or a plainly equivalent phrase. Since \\'compensated\\' is not stated, even if implied by clinical context, the full fact as phrased is not explicitly documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 10, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** The patient had alcohol ketosis on presentation \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of alcohol ketosis on presentation. While the patient was admitted for alcohol withdrawal and has a documented history of alcohol use disorder, the summary does not indicate ketosis as part of her initial presentation or during her hospital stay. The metabolic derangements mentioned include electrolyte imbalances (sodium 134, potassium 5.3) and liver function abnormalities, but ketosis is not specifically mentioned. The patient\\'s presentation focused on withdrawal symptoms (CIWA score >15) rather than ketosis. Even though alcohol related complications are extensively discussed, including liver injury and withdrawal syndrome, ketosis is not among the documented findings or diagnoses.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'alcohol ketosis\\' on presentation. The summary discusses the patient\\'s admission for concerns of ethanol (ETOH) withdrawal and mentions alcohol withdrawal syndrome as the primary diagnosis. It details the management of withdrawal symptoms and the patient\\'s history of alcohol dependence. However, it does not directly mention \\'alcohol ketosis\\' or a condition directly equivalent to it, such as \\'alcoholic ketoacidosis.\\' The closest related information is the discussion of the patient\\'s alcohol use disorder and the presence of mixed or cholestatic liver injury, but these do not directly imply alcohol ketosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'alcohol ketosis\\' or any clear synonyms. While the patient was admitted for alcohol withdrawal and had a history of alcohol dependence, the documented lab results (electrolytes, liver enzymes, platelet count) and diagnoses (alcohol withdrawal syndrome, mixed liver injury) do not include references to ketosis, ketonuria, or metabolic acidosis. The management described (thiamine, benzodiazepines) is consistent with alcohol withdrawal but does not specifically address ketosis. No lab values for ketones or bicarbonate levels are provided. The term \\'alcohol ketosis\\' or its equivalents are absent from both the problem list and diagnostic sections.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 11, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for a fall with humerus fracture and pain\\n\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states in the \\'Reason for Admission\\' section that the patient was admitted \\'after a mechanical fall that resulted in a right humerus fracture.\\' While pain is not explicitly mentioned in the admission reason, it is strongly implied as a consequence of the injury (e.g., fracture management, pain control measures in discharge status). However, since the specific inclusion of \\'pain\\' in the admission context is not directly stated, and the guidelines require explicit mention (verbatim, paraphrased, or equivalent), the fact is coded as 0. The absence of \\'pain\\' in the admission reason section, despite its clinical relevance, meets the threshold for 0 under the provided criteria.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 12, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient sent to the hospital from home for symptoms of tachycardia, hypotension, found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula\\n\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly lists \\'hypotension and tachycardia\\' as part of the Reason for Admission and in Problem #1 , confirming the symptoms. 2. The Secondary Diagnoses section and Problem #2 explicitly state \\'new gallbladder enteric fistula\\' as a diagnosis, supported by CT findings. 3. However, the summary does not explicitly mention the patient being \\'sent to the hospital from home\\' for these symptoms. While discharge plans reference returning home, the admission source (home) is not explicitly stated in the admission context. 4. Since the \\'sent from home\\' component of the fact is missing, the full fact as phrased is not explicitly documented, despite the other elements being present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 12, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was started on empiric antibiotics but was found to have a normal WBC with normal lactate and abx were discontinued, he was not discharged on antibiotics\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I searched for any mentions of: 1) empiric antibiotics being started, 2) WBC count findings, 3) lactate results, and 4) antibiotic discontinuation. The summary does not explicitly mention any of these elements. While there is mention of an \\'infectious workup\\' being planned in relation to the gallbladder enteric fistula (\"The patient was planned for an infectious workup, evaluation, and possible drainage of the gallbladder enteric fistula\"), there is no specific mention of antibiotics being started and then discontinued, no mention of WBC count results, and no mention of lactate levels. The discharge medication list also does not indicate whether antibiotics were or were not included. Therefore, while infection was considered in the workup, the specific sequence of events described in the fact (empiric antibiotics → normal WBC and lactate → antibiotic discontinuation → no antibiotics at discharge) is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention that the patient was started on empiric antibiotics, had a normal WBC with normal lactate, and that antibiotics were discontinued. It also does not explicitly state that the patient was not discharged on antibiotics. The summary does mention an \\'infectious workup\\' and \\'evaluation for possible drainage of the fistula,\\' indicating that infection was considered, but it does not provide details on antibiotic use or discontinuation. The medications section lists medications the patient was continued on or started, but does not mention antibiotics. Therefore, the specific fact about being started on empiric antibiotics, having normal WBC and lactate leading to their discontinuation, and not being discharged on antibiotics is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' section: Mentions infectious workup but no reference to empiric antibiotics being started. 2. Checked \\'Medications\\' section: Lists home meds and norepinephrine, but no antibiotics (started or discontinued). 3. Scanned \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\': Normal WBC/lactate not mentioned only low albumin, elevated ALKP, and anemia/HGB are noted. 4. Examined Problem Based Summary: Under gallbladder fistula management, mentions \\'infectious workup\\' but no antibiotic details. 5. Conclusion section confirms discharge without mentioning antibiotic discontinuation. No sections contain the specific sequence of empiric antibiotics → normal WBC/lactate → discontinuation → no discharge Rx described in the target fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 12, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was discharged on TPN with instructions to follow up in 4 weeks  \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary looking for explicit mention of discharge on TPN with 4 week follow up instructions. While the summary clearly mentions that the patient was discharged on TPN (multiple references including \\'discharge to home with home health services, including TPN administration via Soleo Health Infusion\\'), there is no explicit mention of a 4 week follow up instruction. The discharge plans are mentioned in several places, particularly in Format 1 Section 9 and Format 2\\'s Problem #1 and #4 sections, but none specify a 4 week follow up timeline. Since both components of the fact (TPN at discharge AND 4 week follow up) must be present, and the follow up timing is not mentioned, this specific fact is not fully present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s condition and treatment plan at discharge. Under \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge\\' and \\'Problem #4: Malnutrition\\', it is mentioned that the patient was discharged with arrangements for home TPN administration via Soleo Health Infusion. However, the specific instruction to follow up in 4 weeks is not explicitly mentioned in the summary. The discharge plan includes home health services and TPN administration, but does not specify a follow up timeframe.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient was discharged on TPN (e.g., \\'continued TPN administration via cyclic TPN meeting 100% needs\\' and \\'arrangements for home TPN have been made with Soleo Health Infusion\\'). However, the instruction to \\'follow up in 4 weeks\\' is not explicitly stated anywhere in the text. While discharge plans, home health services, and TPN administration are detailed, no specific follow up timeframe (e.g., 4 weeks) is provided. The absence of this temporal component means the full fact is not mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 13, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt has significant mental health history including anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder and did have a panic attack while admitted \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact is partially but not completely mentioned in the summary. The hospital course summary clearly documents the patient\\'s mental health history, specifically listing bipolar disorder, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, and anxiety in both the \\'Relevant Medical History\\' and \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\' sections. However, while the mental health conditions are documented, there is no explicit mention of the patient having a panic attack during this admission. The summary discusses various aspects of the patient\\'s hospital course, including pain management, hypertension, diabetes management, and wound care issues, but does not document any panic attacks or acute anxiety episodes during the hospitalization. Since the fact we\\'re looking for specifically includes both the mental health history AND the occurrence of a panic attack during admission, and the latter is not mentioned, we cannot consider this fact as fully present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides a detailed account of the patient\\'s admission, medical history, surgical history, primary and secondary diagnoses, diagnostic investigations, therapeutic procedures, and patient\\'s condition at discharge. The summary is presented in two formats: a standard section based summary and a problem based summary. The patient\\'s significant mental health history is mentioned under \\'Relevant Medical History\\' and \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\' in the standard section based summary, where it is stated that the patient has a history of bipolar disorder, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, and anxiety attacks. However, there is no explicit mention of the patient having a panic attack during admission in either the standard section based summary or the problem based summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Checked \\'Relevant Medical History\\' section: Explicitly lists bipolar disorder, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, and anxiety attacks. 2. Reviewed \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\': Confirms anxiety is listed as a diagnosis. 3. Scanned entire document for \\'panic attack\\' occurrence: No mention of panic attacks occurring during this admission in any section (operative course, problem based summaries, or discharge condition). 4. While mental health history components (anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, BPD) are clearly documented, the specific fact of a panic attack occurring during admission is absent from the record. 5. Conclusion: The four psychiatric diagnoses are explicitly stated, but the panic attack during admission a time bound event is not documented in this summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly lists type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) under secondary diagnoses and provides glucose readings (157 207 mg/dL) with the assessment \\'relatively controlled blood glucose levels\\' in Problem #4. While elevated glucose values are noted, the summary does not describe worsening of DM2 (e.g., hyperglycemic emergencies, insulin requirement escalation, or documentation of decompensation). The discharge plan for DM2 focuses on continued monitoring and existing management. However, the specific statement that chronic conditions including DM2 \\'were not worsened perioperatively\\' is not explicitly made in the text. The absence of deterioration is implied through clinical data and management plans but not directly affirmed.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 14, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Dexamethasone taper was started\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, dexamethasone administration is explicitly mentioned in multiple sections: 1. In section 7 (Therapeutic Procedures Performed): \\'Dexamethasone for NF1 related symptoms, initially 20 mg x1 then 4 mg q6h IV, later transitioned to PO\\' 2. In section 8 (Medications): Listed as one of the \\'new medications started\\' 3. In the Problem Based Summary under Problem #1: Mentions dexamethasone management leading to improvement However, while dexamethasone administration is clearly documented, a specific taper plan or the fact that a taper was initiated is not explicitly mentioned anywhere in the summary. The only information about dexamethasone dosing changes is the transition from IV to PO route. Since the fact we\\'re looking for specifically asks about a dexamethasone taper being started, and this is not explicitly stated, we must conclude this fact is not present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s treatment with dexamethasone for NF1 related symptoms, initially administered intravenously and later transitioned to oral administration. However, it does not explicitly mention that a dexamethasone taper was started. The summary lists the initial dose and the transition from IV to PO but does not specify a taper regimen. Therefore, the fact \\'Dexamethasone taper was started\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I cannot find any explicit mention of viral gastroenteritis as the principal discharge diagnosis. The summary provides multiple sections detailing the patient\\'s course, including: 1. A clear statement of the primary diagnosis as \\'Acute kidney injury (AKI) in the setting of nausea and vomiting\\' 2. A detailed list of secondary diagnoses that doesn\\'t include viral gastroenteritis 3. A problem based summary that lists the major issues addressed during the hospitalization 4. A conclusion section that reiterates the main diagnosis as AKI While the patient did have nausea and vomiting, which can be symptoms of viral gastroenteritis, the summary never explicitly states or concludes that viral gastroenteritis was the principal or final diagnosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides a detailed account of the patient\\'s admission, treatment, and discharge. The primary diagnosis at admission was acute kidney injury (AKI) in the setting of nausea and vomiting. The summary outlines various problems and their status at discharge, including AKI, nausea and vomiting, metabolic acidosis, and others. However, \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' is not mentioned anywhere in the summary as a diagnosis, either primary or secondary, at admission or discharge. The symptoms of nausea and vomiting are discussed, but their cause is not attributed to viral gastroenteritis in the provided text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly lists \\'Acute kidney injury (AKI) in the setting of nausea and vomiting\\' as the Primary Diagnosis and reiterates this in the conclusion. While nausea/vomiting are noted as the clinical context for AKI, the summary does not specify the etiology of these symptoms (e.g., viral gastroenteritis). The discharge diagnoses include AKI, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, and elevated liver enzymes, but no mention of viral gastroenteritis or equivalent terms (e.g., \\'viral illness,\\' \\'gastroenteritis\\') appears in any section. The absence of this specific diagnosis or its clear synonyms supports a conclusion that it is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 16, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Currently on high dose dexamethasone and Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that: 1. Dexamethasone is mentioned in two places: Section 8 (Medications): \\'Started: dexamethasone for vasogenic edema\\' Section 9 (Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge): \\'Continued on dexamethasone\\' However, the dose is not specified as \\'high dose\\' 2. Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis is not mentioned anywhere in the summary. The medications list includes dexamethasone, levothyroxine, and atorvastatin, but no Bactrim No mention of PCP prophylaxis in any section Therefore, while dexamethasone use is documented, the specific fact about \\'high dose dexamethasone and Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis\\' is not fully or explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient was started on dexamethasone for vasogenic edema and was continued on it at discharge. However, there is no explicit mention of \\'high dose dexamethasone\\' or \\'Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\' in the provided summary. The medications section lists the started, continued, and discontinued medications but does not include Bactrim or any reference to Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Checked the \\'Medications\\' section in both standard and problem based summaries. Dexamethasone is mentioned as started for vasogenic edema and continued at discharge, but there is no mention of \\'high dose\\' specification. 2. Searched for \\'Bactrim\\' or \\'Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\' in all sections. Neither the drug name nor the prophylaxis indication appears in any part of the summary. 3. While dexamethasone use is documented, the absence of both dose specification (high dose) and any reference to Bactrim/PJP prophylaxis meets criteria for 0 according to guidelines requiring explicit mention.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 17, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Delirium tremens requiring intravenous benzodiazepines and phenobarbital for symptom control\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions treatment with intravenous phenobarbital (520 mg IV) and benzodiazepines (Ativan via CIWA protocol) for alcohol withdrawal syndrome with perceptual disturbances, hallucinations, and tremors. However, the term \\'delirium tremens\\' (DT) is never used in the summary. While the described clinical scenario (moderate to severe withdrawal with hallucinations and tremors) and treatment (IV benzodiazepines and phenobarbital) align with DT management, the specific diagnosis of \\'delirium tremens\\' is not explicitly stated. The summary uses terms like \\'alcohol withdrawal syndrome with perceptual disturbance\\' and \\'moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal\\' but does not label the condition as DT. Since the fact requires explicit mention of \\'delirium tremens\\' and no equivalent term or abbreviation is present, the fact is not stated verbatim or via unambiguous clinical synonyms.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative workups. While the summary does mention: 1. The patient was admitted for fever 2. Negative diagnostic workups were performed (blood cultures negative, clean catch urine with no significant findings) 3. The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics However, the summary specifically states that the fever resolved (\\'The patient\\'s condition improved with resolution of fever\\') and does not mention any suspected pulmonary infection. Additionally, while infectious workups were negative, there\\'s no indication that fever persisted despite these negative results. In fact, the Problem #1 section lists \\'Febrile Illness\\' as \\'Resolved\\' with no outstanding issues.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s admission for fever and management of febrile illness. It is noted that the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) due to febrile illness. The summary also mentions that blood cultures were negative, and other diagnostic investigations like urinalysis and CSF analysis did not indicate a significant infection source. The patient\\'s fever resolved, and their condition improved with treatment. The fact \\'Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\' is not explicitly mentioned because there is no clear indication of a suspected pulmonary infection or persistent fever; the fever is noted as resolved by discharge.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions the patient was admitted for fever and received broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime). Blood cultures, CSF analysis, and urinalysis were negative for infection, and CT abdomen/pelvis showed no acute process. However, there is no mention of a suspected pulmonary infection in the text. While fever and negative infectious workups are documented, the specific suspicion of a pulmonary infection (e.g., pneumonia, lung involvement) is absent. The summary focuses on abdominal/CNS lymphoma and general febrile illness without pulmonary references. Thus, the combination of \\'persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative workups\\' is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 18, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma recently complicated by progression to CNS lymphoma\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'CNS progression of lymphoma\\' in the Relevant Medical History and lists \\'High Grade B Cell Lymphoma with CNS Involvement\\' as a problem. However, the specific term \\'Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)\\' is not used. Instead, the diagnosis is described as \\'de novo transformed high grade B cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 translocations. While high grade B cell lymphoma can include DLBCL subtypes, the summary does not explicitly state \\'DLBCL\\' or a clear clinical abbreviation/synonym for it. The CNS progression is clearly documented, but the absence of the specific DLBCL terminology (despite describing a related entity) means the exact fact is not fully captured as phrased.\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 19, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis).\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find an explicit mention of hydronephrosis being complicated by UTIs specifically caused by ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis. While the summary does mention both hydronephrosis and UTIs separately (noting bilateral hydronephrosis in the medical history and current UTI with E. faecalis), it does not explicitly state that hydronephrosis is complicated by these specific organisms. The only organism explicitly mentioned in the cultures is E. faecalis, without mention of ESBL E. coli or Klebsiella. The relationship between the hydronephrosis and UTIs is not explicitly described as causal or complicating. The CT findings do show \\'bilateral mild hydroureteronephrosis\\' and there is mention of recurrent UTIs, but the specific combination of all three organisms complicating hydronephrosis is not stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient has bilateral hydronephrosis and a urinary tract infection (UTI). The urine culture grew E. Faecalis, which is one of the pathogens mentioned in the fact to be verified. The summary does not explicitly mention ESBL E. coli or Klebsiella as complicating the hydronephrosis alongside E. Faecalis. However, it does confirm the presence of hydronephrosis and a UTI caused by E. Faecalis. The fact that the UTI is associated with the patient\\'s hydronephrosis can be inferred from the context, as the patient has a history of recurrent UTIs and bilateral hydronephrosis. Therefore, while the summary does not explicitly state that hydronephrosis is complicated by all three mentioned pathogens (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis), it does confirm the presence of hydronephrosis and a UTI caused by one of them (E. Faecalis).\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly lists \\'bilateral hydronephrosis\\' under both Relevant Medical History and Secondary Diagnoses. 2. The urine culture specifically grew \\'E. Faecalis\\' (Enterococcus faecalis), which is one of the organisms mentioned in the target fact. 3. However, there is no mention of ESBL E. coli or Klebsiella in any part of the document. While the summary describes recurrent UTIs and hydronephrosis as coexisting conditions, it does not explicitly state that hydronephrosis is complicated by infections with all three specified organisms. 4. The presence of one organism (E. Faecalis) without the others, and the lack of explicit causal language linking hydronephrosis to these specific pathogens, means the full fact as phrased is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 19, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Chronic opioid use and opioid-related constipation. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The hospital course summary does contain explicit mentions of both chronic opioid use and opioid related constipation, though they are somewhat indirect. In Problem #4, it mentions the patient negotiating for \\'an increase in her dilaudid dosage,\\' suggesting ongoing opioid use. In Problem #6, it notes the patient has \\'chronic constipation\\' and lists multiple medications for constipation management (miralax, senna, milk of magnesium, bisacodyl). While the summary doesn\\'t explicitly state the constipation is opioid related, the combination of chronic opioid use (dilaudid) and aggressive constipation management with multiple agents strongly implies opioid induced constipation. However, since the direct causal link between opioids and constipation is not explicitly stated, and we are looking for both elements to be clearly mentioned together, this would not meet the criteria for being explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly lists \\'Substance use disorder (PSUD)\\' under Secondary Diagnoses and describes a behavioral incident involving negotiation for increased dilaudid (an opioid) dosage. However, there is no explicit mention of \\'chronic opioid use\\' as a diagnosis or historical element. 2. \\'Constipation\\' is clearly listed as a secondary diagnosis (Problem #6) with a detailed management plan. 3. While opioid related constipation is a logical association given the patient\\'s substance use issues, the text never explicitly links the constipation to opioid use. The summary meets criteria for mentioning constipation but fails to connect it to opioids or state \\'opioid related constipation\\' through any phrasing, abbreviation, or clinical synonym.\\n\\n\\n\\n**34. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact about worsening thrombocytopenia and prednisone taper initiation is partially mentioned in the summary. Let\\'s break down the analysis: 1. Worsening thrombocytopenia is explicitly mentioned: The summary notes \\'progressive thrombocytopenia\\' multiple times Platelet counts are documented showing low values (60 82) Nadir of 42 on 5/11 is mentioned 2. Prednisone initiation is clearly documented: Started on prednisone 40 mg daily Later increased to 100 mg daily 3. However, there is no mention of a prednisone taper being initiated: While prednisone is started and increased, there is no explicit mention of beginning a taper The summary only mentions the current doses Since the taper aspect is not mentioned, and this is a key part of the fact we\\'re looking for, we cannot say the complete fact is present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s management for thrombocytopenia, including the initiation of prednisone. Under \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\', it is mentioned that \\'Started on prednisone 40 mg daily for possible Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura (ITP), later increased to 100 mg daily\\'. The summary also indicates the patient\\'s thrombocytopenia was progressive, with a nadir of 42 on 5/11. However, it does not explicitly mention a \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\'. The closest relevant information is the mention of starting prednisone and the patient\\'s condition of having progressive thrombocytopenia. There is no explicit mention of a prednisone taper or the condition worsening post taper initiation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly states \\'progressive thrombocytopenia\\' in both the Reason for Admission and Problem #3, which is a direct clinical synonym for \\'worsening thrombocytopenia.\\' 2. The Therapeutic Procedures section documents prednisone initiation (40 mg daily, later increased to 100 mg) for possible ITP. However, there is no mention of a prednisone taper (dose reduction schedule) in any section. While prednisone was started and adjusted upward, the term \\'taper\\' (implying dose reduction) or equivalent phrasing is absent. The discharge plan mentions \\'adjust prednisone as necessary\\' but does not specify tapering. 3. Since the fact requires both components (\\'worsening thrombocytopenia\\' AND \\'s/p prednisone taper initiation\\'), and only the first component is explicitly documented, the full fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**35. Patient 20, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of ordering twice weekly CBCs after discharge. While the summary does discuss monitoring platelet counts and includes statements like \\'Follow up CBC with differential\\' under Problem #3\\'s Outstanding/Pending Issues, and mentions the need to monitor platelet counts in several places, it never specifically states that CBCs were ordered to be done twice weekly after discharge. The frequency of post discharge laboratory monitoring is not explicitly detailed in either the standard section based summary or the problem based summary formats. Even in the sections discussing discharge planning and follow up care, there is no mention of the specific twice weekly CBC monitoring schedule.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was thoroughly reviewed to determine if the fact \\'Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\' was explicitly mentioned. Under the \\'Problem #3: Thrombocytopenia\\' section in the Problem Based Summary, it is stated that the \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' include \\'Monitor platelet count.\\' Furthermore, under \\'Outstanding/Pending Issues,\\' it is mentioned that a \\'Follow up CBC with differential\\' is needed. Although the exact frequency of \\'twice weekly\\' is not directly stated, the intent to monitor the platelet count and the mention of a follow up CBC implies that CBC monitoring was planned post discharge. However, the specific frequency of \\'twice weekly\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the provided summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions monitoring platelet count and follow up CBC in the discharge plans for thrombocytopenia (Problem #3). However, the specific frequency of \\'twice weekly CBCs\\' is not explicitly stated anywhere in the text. While monitoring is emphasized, the exact interval (twice weekly) is not documented in either the discharge plans, medications, or conclusion sections. The summary uses general terms like \\'monitor platelet count\\' and \\'follow up CBC\\' without specifying the frequency required to confirm the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**36. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, the fact of \\'recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\' is not explicitly mentioned. While the summary does discuss falls in several places, specifically: 1) The admission was due to \\'several falls at home\\' 2) Problem #4 mentions \\'recurrent falls at home\\', it actually attributes these falls to likely causes rather than describing them as being of unknown etiology. The summary states the falls were \\'likely contributed to by gait instability and dementia.\\' Additionally, while diagnostic workup was performed (CT head, CT chest/abdomen/pelvis), there\\'s no indication that an extensive workup was done specifically to determine the etiology of falls, nor is there any mention that the cause remained unknown despite such workup. The falls are presented as a known issue with identified contributing factors rather than as a mystery that persisted through the hospital stay despite investigation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'recurrent falls at home\\' as a key problem (Problem #4) and states they were \\'likely contributed to by gait instability and dementia.\\' However, the summary does not explicitly state that the etiology of the falls remained unknown despite an extensive inpatient workup. While diagnostic investigations (e.g., CT scans, PT/OT evaluations) were performed, the text attributes the falls to identifiable factors (gait instability, dementia) rather than labeling them as unexplained. The phrase \\'unknown etiology\\' or equivalent terminology is absent, and the workup is not described as \\'extensive\\' in the context of the falls. Thus, while recurrent falls are documented, the specific fact of \\'unknown etiology despite extensive workup\\' is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**37. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary to determine if there is explicit mention that the T6 wedge compression fracture likely occurred before the most recent fall. Following this analysis: 1. The summary mentions a \\'likely subacute T6 compression fracture\\' in the Reason for Admission section 2. A \\'subacute\\' condition typically refers to something that occurred prior to the immediate presenting event 3. However, while the summary mentions \\'recurrent falls\\' and confirms the T6 wedge compression fracture diagnosis, it does not explicitly state that the fracture predated the most recent fall 4. The temporal relationship between the fracture and the most recent fall is not clearly established in the text 5. While it might be clinically reasonable to infer this from the term \\'subacute,\\' the fact is not explicitly stated as required by the guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n**38. Patient 22, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of cholangitis occurring after or following a recent biliary stent exchange. While the summary does mention cholangitis (in the reason for admission and primary diagnosis sections) and also mentions a history of biliary procedures (including ERCP with stent placement in November 2022 and a biliary drain exchange on 12/25/2022), it does not explicitly state that the cholangitis was post procedural or occurred following a recent stent exchange. The cholangitis appears to be related to biliary drain malfunction rather than being described as a post procedural complication. The temporal relationship between any recent stent exchange and the development of cholangitis is not clearly established in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**39. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of continuing or re evaluating Augmentin therapy for 14 days or any duration. While the summary does discuss antibiotic therapy (mentioning Zosyn specifically) and notes that the patient should \\'Complete antibiotic course if needed\\' under Problem #5, it does not specifically mention Augmentin or a plan to re evaluate its continuation prior to a 14 day completion. The only antibiotics explicitly mentioned are Zosyn (as empiric therapy), and there are general references to \\'antibiotic therapy\\' without specifying the type or duration. The fact we\\'re looking for requires specific mention of Augmentin and its re evaluation before a 14 day completion, which is not present in this text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'should continue and re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, there is no direct mention of \\'Augmentin therapy\\' or a plan to re evaluate its continuation before completing 14 days. The summary does mention \\'Continued empiric antibiotics (Zosyn)\\' and completion of antibiotic course if needed for wound infection, but it does not specifically reference \\'Augmentin\\'. Since \\'Augmentin\\' is not mentioned at all, the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions continued empiric antibiotics (Zosyn) and discharge plans to \\'continue with outpatient antibiotic therapy if needed,\\' but does not specifically reference Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate) or any explicit plan to re evaluate continuation prior to 14 day completion. The antibiotic therapy discussed is Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam), and there is no indication of a switch to or consideration of Augmentin in the documented plan. The phrase \\'re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\' or its clinical equivalents (e.g., reassessing antibiotic duration, Augmentin adjustment) is absent from both medication lists and discharge instructions.\\n\\n\\n\\n**40. Patient 22, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** patient should follow up with Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/ Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Poultsides, George, MD in in 2 weeks\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary in both formats (standard section based and problem based), there is no explicit mention of follow up appointments with either an Advanced Practice Provider in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides, George, MD in 2 weeks. While the summary does mention several follow up plans (including with infectious disease, interventional radiology, endocrinology, SLP, and the Nutrition Cancer Center RD), these specific appointments and providers are not mentioned. The closest references are general statements about follow up care, such as \\'outpatient follow up\\' and \\'regular follow up,\\' but these do not specify the timing or providers mentioned in the fact we\\'re looking for.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, treatment, and discharge plan. To determine if the specific fact about follow up appointments is mentioned, we need to look for any reference to follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider (APP) and Dr. Poultsides, George, MD. The summary outlines various follow up plans under the \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' sections for different problems. However, it does not explicitly mention a follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider in 1 week. It also does not mention follow up with Dr. Poultsides, George, MD in 2 weeks. The closest relevant information is found under the various \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' sections, which mention follow up with different specialists but not the specific individuals or timeframe mentioned in the fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions plans for outpatient follow up with various specialists (infectious disease, interventional radiology, endocrinology, SLP, nutrition services) and references Dr. Butler for oncology care. However, there is no explicit mention of follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant) in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides, George, MD in 2 weeks. The specific providers and timeframes listed in the fact are absent from both the discharge plans and conclusion sections. While follow up coordination is emphasized, the exact providers and timelines required by the fact are not stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**41. Patient 23, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary to look for explicit mention of \\'progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\' as a combined clinical context. While the summary mentions both CLL and mitral valve related issues separately, it doesn\\'t explicitly state that any conditions occurred \\'in the setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy.\\' Specifically: 1. For CLL: The summary mentions Rai Stage II CLL diagnosed in 2009 and current leukocytosis of 477K, but doesn\\'t explicitly characterize it as \\'progressing\\' 2. For mitral valve: While there is mention of previous MVR (mitral valve replacement) in 2014, current mitral valvulopathy is not explicitly discussed 3. The combination of these conditions as a unified clinical context is not explicitly stated While both conditions are present in the patient\\'s history, the specific phrasing and context we\\'re looking for is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly mentions \\'Rai Stage II CLL\\' and current management (holding/resuming Duvelisib, obinutuzumab use), but does not explicitly state that the CLL is \\'progressing\\' leukocytosis is noted but could represent chronic disease rather than progression. 2. Mitral valvulopathy is implied by the patient\\'s history of mitral valve replacement (MVR), but the term \\'mitral valvulopathy\\' or any direct synonym (e.g., \\'mitral valve disease\\') is absent. Current echocardiogram findings focus on tricuspid regurgitation, not mitral pathology. While both components of the fact are contextually plausible given the history, neither is explicitly stated in the hospital course summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**42. Patient 23, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the entire hospital course summary, including both the standard section based and problem based formats, I do not find any explicit mention of plans for cardiology to coordinate follow up with the Heart Failure team specifically regarding transcatheter MVR or a new clinical trial drug in 4/2023. While there are multiple references to the patient\\'s cardiac conditions (including previous MVR and current heart failure management) and mentions of cardiology follow up (e.g., \\'follow up with cardiology\\' under Problem #7), the specific detail about transcatheter MVR discussion and a clinical trial drug for 4/2023 is not present. The closest related information is general cardiology follow up for heart failure management, but this does not include the specific elements we\\'re looking for.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if it mentions that \\'Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\'. The summary does not explicitly mention \\'transcatheter MVR\\', \\'Heart Failure team\\', or any \\'new clinical trial drug\\' scheduled for April 2023. While it does mention \\'follow up with cardiology\\' under Problem #7: Heart Failure Exacerbation, the specific details about transcatheter MVR and a new clinical trial drug are not present. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions follow up with cardiology for heart failure management but does not explicitly state that Cardiology will coordinate with the Heart Failure team regarding a transcatheter MVR or a new clinical trial drug in April 2023. The discharge plan for Problem #7 (Heart Failure Exacerbation) only specifies \\'follow up with cardiology\\' and continuation of Lasix. While MVR (mitral valve replacement) is noted in the patient\\'s surgical history, there is no mention of a transcatheter approach or any clinical trial drug related to cardiology in 2023. The absence of these specific details indicates the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**43. Patient 24, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary step by step: 1. First checked the \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge\\' section which mentions \\'started on full fluids\\' 2. Then reviewed the \\'Medications\\' section which shows the patient was on pain medications (oxycodone, IV APAP) 3. In Format 2, under Problem #1, it confirms \\'started on full fluids\\' 4. However, while the diet component (full liquids) is explicitly mentioned, there is no explicit statement about being discharged on oral pain medications 5. While pain medications were given during the stay, the summary does not specifically state that oral pain medications were prescribed at discharge 6. Since both components (full liquid diet AND oral pain medications at discharge) must be present for the fact to be considered fully mentioned, and only one component is clearly stated, this fact is not completely present\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if the fact \\'discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary indicates that the patient was \\'started on full fluids\\' at discharge (Section 9: Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge and Problem #1: Recurrent Small Bowel Obstruction). While \\'full fluids\\' is not exactly synonymous with \\'full liquid diet,\\' in a clinical context, they are often used interchangeably or considered similar enough for general understanding. The summary also mentions that the patient was continued on IV APAP for pain during the hospital stay (Section 8: Medications), but it does not explicitly state that the patient was discharged on oral pain medications. However, given the context that the patient was clinically stable and improving, it is plausible that pain management was continued orally. The explicit mention of \\'full fluids\\' aligns with \\'full liquid diet,\\' and while there\\'s an implication of ongoing pain management, the specific detail about being \\'discharged on oral pain medications\\' is not directly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions the patient was started on \\'full fluids\\' at discharge, which is a clinical synonym for a full liquid diet. However, there is no mention of oral pain medications being prescribed or continued at discharge. The medications section notes IV APAP (acetaminophen) was used during hospitalization and prior oxycodone use, but discharge instructions do not include oral pain medications. Since only one component of the fact (diet) is present and the other (oral pain medications) is absent, the combined fact is not fully stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**44. Patient 25, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find the specific fact mentioned explicitly. While the summary does discuss duodenitis with gastric distention and mentions an \\'Upper GI single contrast study showing mucosal fold thickening with nodularity along the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum,\\' it does not specifically state that there was \\'no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum.\\' Additionally, while famotidine is mentioned in the medication list, there is no explicit mention of switching to PPI BID or discussions with GI specialists about deferring EGD/ERCP with recommendations for empiric PPI therapy. The summary does note \\'possible ERCP\\' under outstanding issues, but the specific consultation details and treatment plan described in the fact are not present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The important fact to look for is \\'Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\' The hospital course summary mentions an \\'Upper GI single contrast study showing mucosal fold thickening with nodularity along the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum,\\' which is related but not exactly the same as the fact. However, it does not explicitly state the results of the Upper GI series regarding gastric outlet obstruction or the subsequent management with IV famotidine and PPI as described in the fact. The summary does mention that the patient was managed with IV famotidine and later lists \\'famotidine 20mg BID for acid reflux\\' among continued medications, indicating some similarity in treatment. Nonetheless, the specific details about the Upper GI series results and the GI consultation recommendations are not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Upper GI series: The summary mentions an \\'Upper GI single contrast study showing mucosal fold thickening with nodularity along the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum\\' but does NOT explicitly state absence of gastric outlet obstruction or duodenal obstruction. The findings described suggest possible pathology rather than ruling out obstruction. 2. Famotidine/PPI: The summary notes famotidine 20mg BID was continued (not initiated) and does not mention switching to PPI BID. IV famotidine initiation is not documented. 3. GI consultation: While follow up for possible ERCP is mentioned under Problem #8, there is no explicit documentation of discussions with GI specialists deferring EGD/ERCP or recommending empiric PPI for 8 weeks. The PPI recommendation and timeline are absent. Conclusion: None of the three key components of the fact are explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**45. Patient 25, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary in both formats (standard section based and problem based), there is no explicit mention of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) on admission or its treatment with fluids. The summary extensively details multiple medical issues including pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ascites, portal vein thrombosis, hypothyroidism, acid reflux, rhinovirus infection, severe neutropenia, and duodenitis with gastric distention. While fluid management is mentioned in the context of ascites (with paracentesis and diuretics), there is no indication of AKI or kidney dysfunction at any point during the admission. The laboratory values mentioned focus on albumin, potassium, and white blood cell count, but do not include any reference to kidney function markers such as creatinine or BUN. Therefore, the specific fact of \\'AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved\\' is not present in this hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved.\\' To determine this, we reviewed the provided summary, checking sections such as \\'Reason for Admission,\\' \\'Relevant Medical History,\\' \\'Primary Diagnosis,\\' \\'Secondary Diagnoses,\\' \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results,\\' \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed,\\' and \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge.\\' We also examined the \\'Problem Based Summary\\' for any mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) or related conditions. None of these sections directly or indirectly mention AKI or its treatment with fluids. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\' section: No mention of AKI or acute kidney injury. 2. Checked \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\': No elevated creatinine or BUN values reported. 3. Scanned \\'Therapeutic Procedures\\' and \\'Medications\\': Diuretics (Lasix/spironolactone) were used for ascites, but no documentation of IV hydration for AKI. 4. Examined Problem Based Summary: AKI is not listed as a problem, and \\'severe neutropenia\\' resolution is mentioned but not AKI. 5. No references to renal function improvement, fluid resuscitation for AKI, or resolution of kidney injury in discharge summary. The fact \\'AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved\\' is not explicitly stated in any form.\\n\\n\\n\\n**46. Patient 26, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Metoprolol dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily for improved rate control; Apixaban dosage increased to 5 mg twice daily for anticoagulation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that while metoprolol and apixaban dosage changes are mentioned, they don\\'t exactly match the specific fact we\\'re looking for. The summary indicates that metoprolol was \\'increased to 75mg daily and further to 150mg daily, split into q6h increments\\' and apixaban was \\'increased to 5 mg BID\\'. While the apixaban change matches (5 mg twice daily), the metoprolol dosing differs from the fact we\\'re looking for (75 mg twice daily). The summary shows a different dosing schedule (150mg daily split q6h). Since both medications and their dose changes are discussed but don\\'t exactly match the specific fact we\\'re seeking, this would be considered not explicitly mentioned as stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**47. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary for explicit mention of a connection between the patient\\'s emesis and chronic mesenteric ischemia due to SMA stenosis. While the CT Angiography finding of \\'Moderate narrowing of the proximal superior mesenteric artery\\' is mentioned in the diagnostic investigations section, the summary does not explicitly state or suggest that this finding is related to the patient\\'s emesis symptoms. The primary diagnosis section attributes the nausea and vomiting to \\'likely consistent with gastritis versus dyspepsia versus gastroparesis exacerbation.\\' Additionally, while the CT showed SMA narrowing, it specifically notes there was \\'no evidence of acute mesenteric ischemia.\\' The summary does not make any connection between the SMA finding and the patient\\'s symptoms, either directly or indirectly.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the CT Abdomen Pelvis Angiography showed \\'moderate narrowing of the proximal superior mesenteric artery without evidence of acute mesenteric ischemia.\\' This indicates that there is stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), which is a key fact related to the potential cause of the patient\\'s emesis being related to chronic mesenteric ischemia. However, the summary does not explicitly state that the patient\\'s emesis is related to chronic mesenteric ischemia. It only reports the presence of SMA stenosis without directly linking it to the patient\\'s symptoms.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary includes CT angiography results showing \\'moderate narrowing of the proximal superior mesenteric artery\\' (SMA stenosis). 2. The summary explicitly states there was \\'no evidence of acute mesenteric ischemia\\' but does not mention chronic mesenteric ischemia. 3. In the primary diagnosis and problem based summary for nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain, the documented differentials are gastritis, dyspepsia, and gastroparesis exacerbation no reference is made to mesenteric ischemia as a potential etiology. 4. While SMA stenosis is identified, the text does not explicitly link it to the patient\\'s emesis or suggest chronic mesenteric ischemia as a contributing factor. The absence of this clinical interpretation (despite the presence of SMA stenosis) means the specific fact is not stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**48. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient was admitted with neutropenic fever and was found to have Coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) bacteremia. The summary details the treatment, which included the administration of antibiotics such as vancomycin and the removal of the PICC line on 3/5. Although the summary does not explicitly state that the PICC was replaced, it mentions under \\'Problem #6: Coagulase Negative Staphylococci Bacteremia\\' that \\'PICC replacement planned prior to discharge.\\' This indicates that while the PICC removal is mentioned, the replacement was planned but not explicitly stated as having been done during the admission. The fact \\'Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics\\' is mostly supported, except the summary refers to \\'Coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS)\\' rather than \\'coagulase negative strep.\\' However, the treatment details align with the fact, considering the common understanding that CoNS is a type of bacterial infection that would be treated similarly. The discrepancy between \\'coagulase negative strep\\' and \\'CoNS\\' is significant but given the context, it appears to be a minor nomenclature issue as both refer to bacterial infections related to indwelling catheters.\\n\\n\\n\\n**49. Patient 27, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that the specific fact is partially mentioned but with a key difference in date. The summary states \\'TTE without evidence of vegetations\\' in section 6 (Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results), but does not specify the date of 3/6/23. The absence of mass is also not explicitly mentioned. While the summary confirms a TTE was performed and showed no vegetations, it does not provide the specific date (3/6/23) or mention the absence of mass that we\\'re looking for. Since the fact we\\'re searching for requires these specific elements (date and absence of mass) and they are not present in the text, this would be considered not explicitly mentioned as stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions a TTE (Transthoracic Echocardiogram) in the \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\' section, stating \\'TTE without evidence of vegetations.\\' However, it does not specify the date of the TTE. The fact to be verified is \\'TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations.\\' Since the date \\'3/6/23\\' is not mentioned in the summary for the TTE, and the summary only generically states \\'TTE without evidence of vegetations,\\' we cannot confirm that the TTE was performed on 3/6/23. The information provided does not explicitly match the fact to be verified because it lacks the specific date.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'TTE without evidence of vegetations\\' under the \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\' section. However, it does not specify the date of the TTE (3/6/23) or mention the absence of a \\'mass.\\' While the absence of vegetations is documented, the omission of both the date and the \\'mass\\' component means the full fact as stated is not explicitly present. The guidelines specify that minor wording gaps (e.g., missing date) and incomplete explanations (e.g., omitting \\'mass\\') do not automatically trigger a 0, but since both critical elements (date and mass) are absent, the fact as written is not fully captured.\\n\\n\\n\\n**50. Patient 27, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I find that while enlarged tonsils are mentioned (\\'mildly enlarged tonsils\\' appears in both the Secondary Diagnoses and CT maxillofacial findings sections), there is no indication that this was diagnosed as tonsillitis or treated specifically with antibiotics for that condition. The antibiotics mentioned (Zosyn, cefepime, vancomycin, linezolid) were primarily used for neutropenic fever and CoNS bacteremia, not for tonsillitis. Additionally, while imaging did show enlarged tonsils (L>R), there were no specific tonsillar symptoms (sore throat, difficulty swallowing, etc.) mentioned in the summary. The enlarged tonsils appear to be an incidental finding rather than a primary clinical concern requiring specific antibiotic treatment.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. The summary mentions \\'mildly enlarged tonsils\\' and a CT maxillofacial showing \\'mild enlarged tonsils L>R, no abscess.\\' However, it does not explicitly mention symptoms suggestive of tonsillitis or its treatment with antibiotics. The patient was treated with antibiotics, but this was for neutropenic fever and Coagulase negative staphylococci bacteremia, not specifically for tonsillitis. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\' which noted CT maxillofacial showed \\'mild enlarged tonsils L>R\\' this satisfies the imaging component. 2. The summary lists \\'mildly enlarged tonsils\\' under Secondary Diagnoses but does not describe localizing symptoms (e.g., sore throat, dysphagia). 3. Antibiotics (Zosyn, vancomycin, linezolid) were administered, but these were primarily for neutropenic fever and CoNS bacteremia rather than explicitly for tonsillar pathology. 4. While enlarged tonsils were identified, there\\'s no direct link between antibiotic treatment and tonsillar pathology in the documentation. The combination of imaging findings + antibiotic treatment exists but isn\\'t connected as treatment for tonsillitis.\\n\\n\\n\\n**51. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I cannot find an explicit mention that bilirubin failed to improve despite PTBD exchange, leading to the hospice decision. In fact, the summary shows the opposite trend: bilirubin values are documented as improving (from 15.4 on admission to 13.4 on 04/08/2023, 12.2 on 04/09/2023, and 10.8 on 04/11/2023). While the summary does indicate that the patient was discharged to home hospice care (through Sequoia Hospice), it does not specify that this decision was made due to failed bilirubin improvement. The transition to hospice appears to be mentioned as part of the overall care plan, but the specific causation (failed bilirubin improvement leading to the hospice decision) is not stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s condition and treatment during hospitalization. To determine if the fact \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice\\' is explicitly mentioned, we need to look for evidence of bilirubin levels before and after PTBD exchange and the decision to transition to home hospice. The summary indicates that the patient underwent PTBD exchange on 04/08/2023 and 04/21/2023. Lab results show total bilirubin was 15.4 on admission, 16.8 on 04/06/2023, 13.4 on 04/08/2023, 12.2 on 04/09/2023, and 10.8 on 04/11/2023. Although the bilirubin level decreased after the first PTBD exchange, it is not explicitly stated that it \\'did not improve\\' after the exchange. However, the trend shows improvement. The summary also confirms the patient was discharged to home hospice care. Thus, the statement is partially incorrect because bilirubin did show some improvement after PTBD exchange, but the patient was indeed transitioned to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary mentions a recent PTBD exchange on 04/21/2023 but does not report bilirubin levels after this procedure. Pre exchange bilirubin levels (04/08 04/11) showed improvement (13.4 → 12.2 → 10.8 mg/dL). The summary explicitly states \\'improving hyperbilirubinemia\\' in Problem #1. 2. The transition to home hospice is clearly documented in both discharge plans and the conclusion. However, there is no indication that the decision to transition was linked to a lack of bilirubin improvement post PTBD exchange. The fact requires both components (bilirubin not improving despite PTBD exchange + hospice transition), but only the hospice component is explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**52. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze each component of the fact: 1. Sepsis requiring antibiotics and fluid resuscitation: The summary mentions \\'recurrent cholangitis\\' with IV antibiotics treatment and IV fluid administration for dehydration, but does not explicitly state \\'sepsis\\' While elevated WBC (18.9) and antibiotics use suggest infection, sepsis is not specifically mentioned 2. Delirium requiring pharmacotherapy: Delirium is mentioned multiple times in the summary However, while medications are listed (including mirtazapine), it\\'s not explicitly stated that any medications were specifically for delirium management 3. Urinary retention requiring catheter: This condition is not mentioned anywhere in the hospital course While Flomax (tamsulosin) is listed as a medication, which can be used for urinary symptoms, there is no mention of urinary retention or catheter placement Since all three components are not explicitly mentioned as stated in the fact (sepsis is not mentioned, pharmacotherapy for delirium is not explicitly linked, and urinary retention with catheter is not mentioned at all), this fact is not fully present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, treatment, and condition at discharge. To determine if the specific fact \\'Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter\\' is mentioned, we need to analyze the summary for each component of this fact. The summary mentions that the patient was admitted for recurrent cholangitis and received IV antibiotics, indicating treatment for an infection. While \\'sepsis\\' is not explicitly mentioned, the context suggests severe infection. The summary also mentions delirium and its management. However, it does not explicitly state that delirium required pharmacotherapy. Lastly, there is no mention of urinary retention or the use of a urinary catheter. Therefore, the fact is not entirely mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis: The summary mentions \\'recurrent cholangitis\\' treated with IV antibiotics (piperacillin tazobactam), but does not explicitly state \\'sepsis\\' or use equivalent terminology. Cholangitis and sepsis are distinct clinical entities. 2. Aggressive fluid resuscitation: While IV fluids were administered for dehydration, the term \\'aggressive fluid resuscitation\\' (implying large volume resuscitation for hemodynamic instability) is not used. 3. Delirium pharmacotherapy: Delirium is noted but managed with a sitter; no medications specifically for delirium (e.g., antipsychotics) are listed in the treatment plan. 4. Urinary retention/catheter: No mention of urinary retention or catheter placement exists in any section. All three required components of the fact are absent from the documentation.\\n\\n\\n\\n**53. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that while the summary mentions both the patient\\'s nasopharyngeal carcinoma and episodes of delirium, it does not explicitly state that management of the cancer was deferred to outpatient oncology due to the son\\'s wishes and the patient\\'s delirium. The summary only indicates in the Problem #1 section that there is a \\'plan for radiation and/or chemotherapy pending\\' and \\'Follow up with oncology for definitive treatment planning.\\' While delirium is discussed in Problem #6, showing the patient required ativan and zyprexa, there is no explicit connection made between the delirium, the son\\'s wishes, and the decision to defer cancer management to outpatient care. The decision making process and the son\\'s involvement in deferring treatment are not mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s diagnosis, treatment, and management during their hospital stay. The specific fact to look for is whether the management of the patient\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was deferred to an outpatient oncologist per the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and the patient\\'s delirium. Upon reviewing the summary, it is noted that the patient has biopsy proven nasopharyngeal carcinoma (T4) with metastatic disease as indicated by PET/CT findings. The summary under \\'Problem #1: Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma\\' mentions that there is a plan for radiation and/or chemotherapy pending and follow up with oncology for definitive treatment planning. However, it does not explicitly state that the management was deferred due to the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes. It does mention the patient\\'s delirium as a significant issue during the hospital stay. The absence of explicit mention of the son\\'s wishes regarding deferring management to an outpatient oncologist is crucial. Thus, while the summary indicates a plan for follow up with oncology, it does not clearly state that the deferment was per the son\\'s wishes.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states under Problem #1 (Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma) that the discharge plan includes \\'Follow up with oncology for definitive treatment planning,\\' indicating management is deferred to outpatient oncology. However, the summary does not explicitly mention the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes as a reason for deferral. While delirium is documented as a resolved issue (Problem #6), it is attributed to language barriers and malnutrition, not cited as a reason to defer cancer management. The two specific elements of the son\\'s involvement and delirium as reasons for deferral are not explicitly linked to the decision in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**54. Patient 29, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step: 1. The fact mentions two key elements: temporary O2 requirement due to aspiration pneumonitis, and being made NPO by SLP. 2. Searching through the summary: Under \\'Problem #7: Aspiration\\', it mentions \\'New cough and signs of aspiration on 07/08/2023\\' Under \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\', there\\'s mention of \\'CXR on 07/08/2023 showed mild increase in left basilar opacities concerning for aspiration\\' Under \\'Problem #4: Dysphagia\\', it mentions SLP involvement and dysphagia precautions 3. However, the text does not explicitly state: That the patient developed a temporary oxygen requirement That this was specifically due to aspiration pneumonitis That SLP specifically made the patient NPO While aspiration is mentioned and SLP involvement is noted, the specific sequence of events and causality described in the target fact is not explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, and treatment. Under \\'Problem #7: Aspiration\\', it is mentioned that the patient had new cough and signs of aspiration on 07/08/2023. The summary also states that the patient was managed with suctioning PRN and educated on aspiration precautions. Furthermore, under \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\', a CXR on 07/08/2023 showed mild increase in left basilar opacities concerning for aspiration. However, the specific fact \\'Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the summary. Although there are indications of aspiration and dysphagia management by SLP, the exact phrase or its equivalent regarding temporary O2 requirement and being made strict NPO is not present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions aspiration (Problem #7) and oxygen desaturation episodes in the Conclusion, but does not explicitly link temporary oxygen requirement to aspiration pneumonitis. While \\'aspiration\\' and CXR findings are noted, the term \\'pneumonitis\\' is absent. SLP involvement in dysphagia management and PEG placement imply NPO status, but there is no explicit statement that SLP enforced \\'strict NPO\\' as a result of aspiration pneumonitis. Both components of the fact are partially addressed but not clearly connected as stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n### B.

Hospital Summary documents \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection... with primary anastomosis\\' and \\'necrotic small bowel mass\\' as primary diagnosis. 3. No mention of omental adhesions being addressed in the surgical procedure description. 4. While the mass removal aligns, the absence of adhesion lysis documentation creates a factual conflict regarding surgical details.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 3, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** R-sided chest pain 2/2 port-associated thrombus\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states R sided chest pain is due to (2/2) port associated thrombus. 2. The Hospital Summary lists \\'R sided chest pain\\' (Problem #1) and \\'Port Thrombus\\' (Problem #2) as separate issues without explicitly linking them. 3. No causal relationship between the chest pain and port thrombus is documented in the summary (e.g., no mention of thrombus related pain). 4. Chest pain management focused on analgesics rather than thrombus targeted therapy (apixaban was initiated for the thrombus itself, not specifically for chest pain).\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 4, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pancreatic tail mass leading to outpatient GI biopsy\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions a pancreatic tail mass that requires EUS/FNA (endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration) and surgical consultation 2. The fact states there was an outpatient GI biopsy 3. Per the summary, the biopsy has not yet occurred it is planned for the future (\\'Planned EUS/FNA\\') 4. The summary indicates this is a new finding being worked up during this admission (\\'admitted for an expedited oncology workup\\') 5. Therefore, the summary directly contradicts the fact about an outpatient biopsy having already occurred\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'Pancreatic tail mass leading to outpatient GI biopsy\\' implying biopsy occurred pre admission. 2. Hospital Summary states \\'Planned EUS/FNA\\' (a biopsy procedure) under Therapeutic Procedures and Discharge Plan, indicating it was scheduled post admission/future care. 3. Admission reason was for \\'expedited oncology workup\\' of the mass, not follow up after an outpatient biopsy. 4. No documentation of prior biopsy in the summary, creating contradiction about biopsy timing/setting.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was admitted for an adrenal crisis likely due to vomiting and possibly inadequate stress dosing of steroids, not intolerance of PO prednisone. The summary states she was on Prednisone 2.5 mg BID and does not mention any issues with PO prednisone tolerance. Thus, the summary does not directly support the Important Fact that the adrenal crisis was likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states adrenal crisis was \\'likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone.\\' 2. Hospital Summary attributes adrenal crisis to \\'vomiting and possibly inadequate stress dosing of steroids.\\' 3. Intolerance implies inability to tolerate the drug (e.g., side effects), while vomiting caused non absorption of PO prednisone. These are distinct mechanisms. 4. Summary does not mention prednisone intolerance as a contributing factor, instead emphasizing vomiting/stress dosing. The two explanations are mutually exclusive.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions the patient was started on \\'Levemir 16 UNITS BID\\' (twice daily) 2. The Important Fact states lantus 15 units twice daily 3. These are different insulins (Levemir vs. Lantus) and different doses (16 vs. 15 units) 4. Since these specific details contradict each other, they cannot both be true\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions that the patient was transitioned to subQ insulin during hospitalization, and at discharge, she was started on Levemir 16 UNITS BID and Insulin 1:7 TID AC. This contradicts the Important Fact that states \\'insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day\\' because the summary does not mention Lantus but instead mentions Levemir.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states insulin was changed to Lantus 15 units BID. 2. Hospital summary\\'s medication section lists \\'Levemir 16 UNITS BID\\' (a different long acting insulin) and \\'Insulin 1:7 TID AC\\'. 3. Problem #5 explicitly states \\'transitioned to subQ insulin\\' with Levemir specified. 4. Lantus and Levemir are distinct insulin formulations. This constitutes a direct therapeutic contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 6, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Vitamin D deficiency, started on replacement, fat soluble vitamins sent, need to follow-up \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'fat soluble vitamins sent\\' (plural). 2. The Hospital Summary under Medications lists only \\'Vitamin D 50,000 IU q7 x4\\' as a specific fat soluble vitamin. 3. No other fat soluble vitamins (A, E, K) are documented in the discharge medications. 4. The plural \\'vitamins\\' in the fact conflicts with the singular vitamin D replacement documented in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 7, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left renal cell carcinoma status-post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post-op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\' prior to surgery. 2. Hospital Summary details surgical history (left nephrectomy/IVC thrombectomy) and postoperative course but never mentions neoadjuvant chemotherapy in any section (Relevant Medical History, Therapeutic Procedures, Medications, or Problem Based Summary). 3. Absence of documentation about neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the summary creates a direct contradiction with the explicitly stated fact, as these cannot both be true if the summary is intended to be comprehensive.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 8, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Down\\'s syndrome, neurogenic bladder, admitted for pneumonia, treated with CAP regimen and vancomycin due to positive sputum culture for MRSA\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states vancomycin was used due to positive sputum culture for MRSA. 2. Summary\\'s sputum culture shows \\'rare to small number Staph aureus\\' without MRSA specification; MRSA positivity is noted in nares, not sputum. 3. Summary explicitly states vancomycin was started for MRSA nares positivity and potential S. aureus pneumonia, conflicting with the stated reason in the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact mentions a \\'Potential aspiration event prior to discharge\\' and \\'1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\'. The Hospital Course Summary does not mention any aspiration event prior to discharge. It also does not mention the results of blood cultures (speciation or GPC positivity) in the context of the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'1/4 bottles positive for GPC\\' with speciation incomplete at discharge. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\' section reports sputum culture with speciated Staph aureus (GPC) and urine culture with S. Aureus, but no mention of pending GPC speciation. 3. Blood cultures are noted as \\'pending during the hospital stay\\' without reported positivity. 4. The combination of speciated results in the summary directly conflicts with the Important Fact\\'s claim of incomplete speciation for a GPC positive culture.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states patient was \\'finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge\\' Summary lists Zosyn and Vancomycin as antibiotics, with no mention of ciprofloxacin in discharge medications. 2. Important Fact states finasteride was started \\'to prevent future UTIs\\' Summary documents finasteride was started specifically \\'for prostatomegaly\\' in both medication lists and Problem #5. 3. These represent direct contradictions in both antibiotic regimen at discharge and medication indication.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 10, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** The patient had alcohol ketosis on presentation \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'alcohol ketosis on presentation\\'. 2. The Hospital Course Summary\\'s \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\' section lists labs (electrolytes, liver enzymes, platelets) but no mention of ketones, anion gap, or bicarbonate levels. 3. Secondary diagnoses include \\'mixed/cholestatic liver injury\\' and \\'pancytopenia\\' but no reference to ketosis. 4. Treatment included thiamine/lorazepam/phenobarbital (standard for withdrawal) but no IV dextrose/fluids addressing ketosis. 5. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome diagnosis (without complication) and management described do not align with documented ketosis care.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'unremarkable post operative course\\' with discharge home. 2. Hospital Summary documents \\'elevated blood pressures ranging 120 202/80 121 mmHg\\' (Problem #3) and \\'skin tear in left axilla and blistering on coccyx with surrounding erythema\\' requiring wound care (Problem #5). 3. These complications (hypertensive crisis level BP and skin integrity issues) contradict the characterization of the post op course as \\'unremarkable\\'. 4. Discharge documentation of these active issues conflicts with the assertion of an uneventful recovery.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 13, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt has significant mental health history including anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder and did have a panic attack while admitted \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states patient \\'did have a panic attack while admitted\\' 2. Hospital summary lists anxiety in medical history and secondary diagnoses 3. No mention of panic attacks occurring during admission in: Medications section (only mentions anxiety as condition) Problem based summary sections Discharge condition description 4. Summary documents multiple other events (hypertension episodes, wound issues) but not panic attacks 5. Absence of documentation about in hospital panic attack creates contradiction with stated fact\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The hospital course summary clearly states the primary diagnosis as \\'Acute kidney injury (AKI) in the setting of nausea and vomiting\\' (Section 4) 2. Throughout the detailed summary, there is no mention of viral gastroenteritis as the principal diagnosis 3. While nausea and vomiting are mentioned, they are described as symptoms contributing to the AKI rather than being attributed to a viral cause 4. The treatment approach focused on AKI management, fluid resuscitation, and medication adjustments, not on treating viral gastroenteritis\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was admitted with acute kidney injury (AKI) in the setting of nausea and vomiting. The Principal diagnosis at discharge was stated as viral gastroenteritis in the Important Fact. However, the Hospital Course Summary does not mention viral gastroenteritis as a diagnosis; instead, it lists AKI in the setting of nausea and vomiting as the Primary Diagnosis. The summary does provide details on the patient\\'s nausea and vomiting but attributes it to AKI rather than viral gastroenteritis. The CT Abdomen Pelvis without IV Contrast showed lower esophageal wall thickening with trace surrounding free fluid, but no acute process in the abdomen and pelvis, which does not directly support a diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis. Thus, the summary contradicts the fact because it does not support viral gastroenteritis as the principal diagnosis at discharge.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis. 2. Hospital Summary lists \\'Primary Diagnosis: Acute kidney injury (AKI) in the setting of nausea and vomiting\\'. 3. No mention of viral gastroenteritis in either diagnosis section or problem based summary. 4. AKI is attributed to nausea/vomiting, but the underlying cause (viral gastroenteritis) is not documented in the summary. 5. Both documents describe the same hospitalization but assign different principal diagnoses that cannot coexist as stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 16, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Currently on high dose dexamethasone and Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states patient is on Bactrim for Pneumocystis prophylaxis. 2. Hospital summary\\'s medication list (section 8) mentions dexamethasone but no Bactrim. 3. Prophylaxis would typically be documented in discharge medications. 4. Absence of Bactrim in summary directly contradicts stated prophylaxis regimen.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 17, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Delirium tremens requiring intravenous benzodiazepines and phenobarbital for symptom control\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'delirium tremens\\' requiring IV benzodiazepines and phenobarbital. 2. Summary explicitly diagnoses \\'alcohol withdrawal syndrome with perceptual disturbance\\' and describes \\'moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal with hallucinations and tremors\\'. 3. While treatment (phenobarbital 520 mg IV + Ativan via CIWA protocol) aligns with delirium tremens management, the summary never uses the term \\'delirium tremens\\' in diagnoses. 4. \\'Alcohol withdrawal syndrome with perceptual disturbance\\' is a distinct diagnostic category from delirium tremens in clinical terminology, creating a direct contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was admitted for fever, started on broad spectrum antibiotics, and subsequently showed resolution of fever. The summary lists \\'Febrile Illness\\' under Problem #1 with \\'Current Clinical Status: Resolved.\\' Key diagnostic investigations, such as blood cultures and urinalysis, were negative or showed no significant findings. The Important Fact states \\'Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups.\\' The summary contradicts this fact because it indicates resolution of fever and does not support the persistence of fever.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups.\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary documents resolution of fever (\\'condition improved with resolution of fever\\') and lists febrile illness as \\'Resolved\\' in Problem #1. 3. Negative infectious workups are confirmed (blood cultures, CSF analysis, urinalysis, CT abdomen/pelvis). 4. The resolution of fever contradicts the \\'persistent fever\\' claim in the Important Fact, while the absence of documented pulmonary infection suspicion in the summary further supports inconsistency.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 18, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma recently complicated by progression to CNS lymphoma\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)\\' with CNS progression. 2. The Hospital Summary specifies \\'de novo transformed high grade B cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 translocations\\' as the primary diagnosis. 3. High grade B cell lymphoma with MYC/BCL2 rearrangements is a distinct entity from DLBCL per WHO classification, making these diagnoses mutually exclusive. 4. The summary does not mention DLBCL, creating a direct contradiction with the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 19, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis).\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions urine culture growing E. Faecalis only, while the fact states multiple organisms (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis) 2. The summary confirms hydronephrosis (mentions \\'bilateral hydronephrosis\\' and \\'bilateral mild hydroureteronephrosis\\') 3. While both documents link UTIs and hydronephrosis, the specific organisms mentioned in the fact are not all present in the summary 4. This represents a clear factual discrepancy in the microbiology findings\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states hydronephrosis is complicated by UTIs caused by ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s urine culture specifically identifies E. Faecalis as the pathogen in this admission. 3. No mention of ESBL E. coli or Klebsiella in current UTI pathogens. 4. Presence of only E. Faecalis in culture directly conflicts with the multi organism assertion in the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was started on prednisone 40 mg daily, which was later increased to 100 mg daily for possible Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura (ITP). The summary also mentions that the patient had progressive thrombocytopenia with a nadir of 42 on 5/11. The Important Fact states \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\'. The summary does not explicitly mention a \\'taper\\' of prednisone; instead, it mentions an increase in prednisone dosage from 40 mg to 100 mg daily. The presence of worsening thrombocytopenia is consistent with the summary, but the initiation of a prednisone taper is not directly supported or refuted by the information given in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\' implying platelet decline after starting steroid taper. 2. Hospital summary shows platelet count increased from 42 (5/11) to 67 (5/12) to 82 (5/13) while prednisone was being increased (40 mg → 100 mg daily). 3. Summary documents prednisone dose escalation rather than tapering, with corresponding platelet improvement. 4. These trajectories (increasing platelets with dose escalation vs. worsening with taper) are mutually exclusive.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary does not contradict the fact about recurrent falls of unknown etiology. 2. The summary actually provides clear explanations for the falls: Patient has dementia which contributes to fall risk Gait instability is noted Physical therapy evaluations were ordered specifically to address mobility and fall prevention 3. Rather than being \\'unknown etiology despite extensive workup\\', the falls appear to have identifiable contributing factors.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient.\\' 2. The Hospital Summary explicitly attributes falls to \\'gait instability and dementia\\' (Problem #4), indicating identified contributing factors. 3. The summary documents PT/OT evaluations and fall prevention strategies, demonstrating a workup derived etiology. 4. This directly contradicts the claim of \\'unknown etiology\\' in the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the T6 fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall.\\' 2. The Hospital Summary describes the T6 fracture as \\'subacute\\' and attributes it to \\'several falls at home\\' leading to admission. 3. \\'Subacute\\' implies the fracture occurred days to weeks prior, which would predate the most recent fall(s) that prompted admission. 4. This creates a contradiction: The summary links the fracture to the falls causing admission, while the fact asserts it preceded them.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 22, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The important fact mentions \\'post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\' 2. The hospital summary describes cholangitis with biliary drain malfunction as the REASON for admission, not as a post procedural complication 3. The timeline shows the biliary drain exchange was performed DURING the admission (12/25/2022) to treat the existing cholangitis, not before it 4. The cholangitis preceded the procedure rather than following it 5. This represents a clear contradiction in the sequence of events\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'Post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\'. 2. Hospital Summary documents biliary drain exchange on 12/25/2022 under Therapeutic Procedures. 3. Summary attributes cholangitis to \\'biliary drain malfunction\\' (Primary Diagnosis section) rather than procedural complication. 4. No mention of procedure related cholangitis in Key Diagnostic Investigations or Problem #1 analysis. 5. These represent conflicting etiologies for cholangitis (drain malfunction vs post procedural complication).\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact specifies need to \\'continue and re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to 14 day completion\\' 2. Hospital summary under \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' states \\'Continued empiric antibiotics (Zosyn)\\' 3. No mention of Augmentin (amoxicillin clavulanate) in medications or discharge plans 4. Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam) and Augmentin are different antibiotics 5. Summary indicates resolved sepsis with current therapy, contradicting need for Augmentin continuation/re evaluation\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 23, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'mitral valvulopathy\\' as a current condition. 2. Hospital Summary documents \\'mitral valve replacement (MVR) with bioprosthetic valves in 2014\\' in surgical history. 3. Post MVR, native mitral valve pathology would be resolved unless prosthetic dysfunction is documented, which is not mentioned. 4. Summary\\'s echocardiogram findings describe severe tricuspid regurgitation but no mitral valve abnormalities. 5. Presence of MVR in summary directly contradicts ongoing mitral valvulopathy in Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 23, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact mentions that Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR and a likely new clinical trial drug in 4/2023. The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient has a history of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and post aortic valve replacement (AVR) and mitral valve replacement (MVR). Under \\'Problem #7: Heart Failure Exacerbation\\', it is mentioned that the discharge plan includes continuing Lasix and follow up with cardiology. However, there is no mention of plans for transcatheter MVR or discussion of a new clinical trial drug in the Hospital Course Summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states Cardiology will coordinate follow up with Heart Failure team for transcatheter MVR/clinical trial drug. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s \\'Problem #7: Heart Failure Exacerbation\\' discharge plan only mentions \\'follow up with cardiology\\' without any reference to Heart Failure team coordination, transcatheter MVR, or clinical trial drugs. 3. No other sections mention these specific cardiology actions, creating a clear contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 25, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states Upper GI showed no gastric outlet/duodenal obstruction, but Summary\\'s Upper GI report describes \\'mucosal fold thickening with nodularity\\' in distal duodenum though not explicitly stating obstruction. 2. Important Fact specifies switch from IV famotidine to PPI BID, but Summary\\'s medications list only continued famotidine without PPI documentation. 3. Important Fact notes GI teams deferred EGD/ERCP, while Summary\\'s Problem #8 lists \\'possible ERCP for CBD stricture\\' as outstanding issue. 4. These discrepancies in medication regimen and procedural planning constitute direct contradictions.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 25, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states AKI was present on admission and resolved with fluids 2. The Hospital Course Summary contains no mention of AKI (acute kidney injury) in any section 3. Key sections that would document AKI (Diagnoses, Therapeutic Procedures, Medications) show diuretics use for ascites but no AKI management 4. Problem Based Summary lists 8 active problems but none related to renal issues 5. No documentation of fluid resuscitation for AKI or resolution of renal injury\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 26, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Metoprolol dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily for improved rate control; Apixaban dosage increased to 5 mg twice daily for anticoagulation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states metoprolol was increased to 150mg daily (split into q6h increments), while the fact states 75mg twice daily. 2. The summary mentions apixaban was increased to 5mg BID, which exactly matches the fact. 3. Since there is a clear discrepancy in the metoprolol dosing (150mg daily vs 75mg twice daily), this represents a contradiction.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that Metoprolol dosage was increased to 75 mg twice daily and Apixaban dosage was increased to 5 mg twice daily. The Hospital Course Summary under \\'Medications\\' section states that metoprolol was \\'increased to 75mg daily and further to 150mg daily, split into q6h increments\\', which implies a total daily dose of 150 mg, not 75 mg twice daily (150 mg total daily dose is consistent but the frequency differs). The same section confirms that apixaban was \\'increased to 5 mg BID\\', which matches the Important Fact. The \\'Problem #2: Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter with Rapid Ventricular Response\\' section confirms the discharge medication as \\'metoprolol succinate 150 mg daily (split into q6h increments)\\', reinforcing the total daily dose but not the twice daily frequency as stated in the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states metoprolol was dosed at 75 mg twice daily (total 150 mg/day). 2. Summary states metoprolol was increased to 150 mg daily split into q6h increments (37.5 mg every 6 hours, totaling 150 mg/day). 3. The total daily dose matches, but the dosing frequency (twice daily vs. four times daily) directly conflicts. 4. Apixaban 5 mg BID in the summary matches the fact\\'s dosage. 5. Contradiction exists in metoprolol administration frequency despite same total dose.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states bacteremia was caused by coagulase negative strep (Streptococcus). 2. Hospital Summary lists \\'Coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) bacteremia\\' in Secondary Diagnoses and Problem #6. 3. Staphylococci (CoNS) and Streptococci are distinct bacterial groups both cannot be true simultaneously. 4. Summary explicitly documents CoNS bacteremia, directly contradicting the Important Fact\\'s coagulase negative strep claim.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 27, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions \\'mildly enlarged tonsils\\' in imaging (CT maxillofacial) but does not indicate tonsillitis 2. The antibiotics mentioned (Zosyn, cefepime, vancomycin, linezolid) were given for neutropenic fever and CoNS bacteremia, not for tonsillitis 3. There are no localizing symptoms of tonsillitis described in the summary 4. The enlarged tonsils were an incidental finding on imaging, not a focus of treatment 5. The fact states tonsillitis was diagnosed and treated, which directly contradicts the hospital course where tonsils were only noted as mildly enlarged without infection\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'Imaging...suggestive of tonsilitis\\' but CT maxillofacial showed \\'mild enlarged tonsils L>R, no abscess\\' without mention of tonsillar exudate or inflammation. 2. While antibiotics were given (cefepime/vancomycin/linezolid), these were directed at CoNS bacteremia and neutropenic fever coverage, not specifically for tonsillitis. 3. Problem #4 lists \\'mildly enlarged tonsils\\' as a diagnosis but no tonsillitis diagnosis is documented. 4. No documentation of localized tonsillitis symptoms (e.g., sore throat, dysphagia) driving antibiotic selection.\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary contradicts the fact about bilirubin not improving: Summary shows clear bilirubin improvement: from 15.4 on admission to 13.4 on 4/8, 12.2 on 4/9, and 10.8 on 4/11 2. The summary indicates transition to hospice was due to overall condition, not due to failed PTBD: States \\'condition improved sufficiently for discharge to home hospice\\' Describes biliary obstruction as \\'improving\\' with plans to possibly cap drain 3. This directly conflicts with the fact stating bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange and that lack of improvement led to hospice decision\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\' The Hospital Course Summary indicates that total bilirubin levels were 15.4 on admission, 13.4 mg/dL on 04/08/2023, 12.2 mg/dL on 04/09/2023, and 10.8 mg/dL on 04/11/2023, showing an improvement in hyperbilirubinemia after PTBD exchange. The summary also mentions that the patient was discharged to home hospice care, which aligns with the Important Fact that the patient/family opted to transition to home hospice. Since the summary shows improvement in bilirubin levels after PTBD exchange, it contradicts the Important Fact that bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange.\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the hospital course was complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter. The Hospital Course Summary mentions that the patient received \\'IV antibiotics for recurrent cholangitis\\', indicating treatment for an infection which aligns with sepsis. It also mentions \\'delirium\\' under Secondary Diagnoses and Problem #6: Delirium, confirming the presence of delirium. However, there is no explicit mention of \\'sepsis\\', \\'aggressive fluid resuscitation\\', or \\'pharmacotherapy\\' for delirium in the summary. Moreover, \\'urinary retention requiring urinary catheter\\' is not mentioned anywhere in the summary. The absence of information on \\'urinary retention requiring urinary catheter\\' directly contradicts the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis: Summary mentions \\'recurrent cholangitis\\' treated with IV antibiotics but does not document sepsis diagnosis or aggressive fluid resuscitation beyond IV fluids for dehydration. 2. Delirium: Summary states \\'delirium required a sitter\\' but does not mention pharmacotherapy for delirium management. 3. Urinary retention: No documentation of urinary retention or catheter placement in the entire summary. All three key elements of the Important Fact are either absent or inadequately addressed.\\n\\n\\n\\n**34. Patient 29, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt w/ metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma admitted for dysphagia and weight loss treated w/ PEG and tube feeding and strict NPO.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'strict NPO\\' (nothing by mouth). 2. Hospital Summary under \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' documents \\'PO trials with ice chips\\'. 3. PO trials (oral intake) directly contradict strict NPO orders. 4. Both cannot be true simultaneously.\\n\\n\\n\\n**35. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was planned for \\'further evaluation and treatment of his nasopharyngeal carcinoma\\' and \\'Follow up with oncology for definitive treatment planning.\\' This contradicts the Important Fact that management of the patient\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was deferred to an outpatient oncologist per the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and the patient\\'s delirium, as it suggests that treatment planning was still being considered and planned for during the hospital stay.\\n\\n\\n\\n**36. Patient 29, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the patient was made \\'strict NPO by SLP\\' due to aspiration pneumonitis. 2. The summary explicitly documents SLP involvement with \\'PO trials with ice chips\\' (Therapeutic Procedures) and plans to \\'re evaluate need for feeding tube after treatment\\' (Problem #4), indicating oral intake was permitted. 3. Strict NPO (nothing by mouth) directly conflicts with documented PO trials. 4. While the summary notes \\'signs of aspiration\\' and \\'mild basilar opacities\\', it does not confirm pneumonitis as the cause of O2 requirements, only listing \\'aspiration\\' as a diagnosis without pneumonitis specification.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Presence of important facts\\n\\n**Score: 58/100** (95% CI: 48-68) (higher values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the important facts missing:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries frequently omit critical clinical details due to recurring patterns: (1) **Incomplete procedural/symptom specificity**, where key surgical steps (Patient 2: adhesions takedown, obstructing mass) or post-op milestones (Patient 2: flatus/bowel movements) are excluded despite mentioning related procedures. (2) **Failure to link related conditions**, such as AKI on CKD (Patient 4) or SMA stenosis to emesis (Patient 26), despite documenting individual components. (3) **Omission of management rationales**, including treatment changes (Patient 6: prednisone intolerance, Patient 7: immunotherapy switch) or specialist recommendations (Patient 25: GI deferring ERCP). (4) **Inaccurate medication/treatment details**, such as insulin type/dose discrepancies (Patient 6: Lantus vs. Levemir) or follow-up frequency (Patient 20: weekly vs. twice-weekly CBCs). (5) **Absence of negative findings**, like DVT ultrasound results (Patient 9) or aspiration events (Patient 8), despite clinical suspicion. (6) **Contradictory documentation**, such as labeling a complicated course as \"unremarkable\" (Patient 13) or citing resolved fever as \"persistent\" (Patient 18). (7) **Lack of temporal/anatomical specificity**, including omitted imaging dates (Patient 27: TTE on 3/6/23) or pain localization (Patient 3: LLQ abdominal pain). These patterns highlight systemic gaps in explicitly connecting findings, documenting rationale, and specifying critical details, leading to incomplete clinical narratives.\\n\\n### B. Hospital course summaries contradicting important facts\\n\\n**Score: 18/100** (95% CI: 11-26) (lower values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the inconsistencies:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries frequently contradict clinical facts due to recurring patterns: (1) **Omission/underdocumentation of acute conditions** (Patient 4: AKI on CKD omitted despite urinary retention, with summary noting only stable CKD IV); (2) **Medication inaccuracies** (Patient 6: Levemir 16U BID documented instead of Lantus 15U BID, conflating distinct insulins); (3) **Diagnostic/timing discrepancies** (Patient 13: \"unremarkable post-op course\" vs. documented pain/hypertension/hyperglycemia; Patient 28: PTBD exchange dated 4/21/23 in fact vs. 4/8/23 in summary); (4) **Misattribution of findings** (Patient 21: \"unknown etiology\" for falls vs. identified NSVT/T6 fracture; Patient 9: finasteride rationale conflicting between UTI prevention and prostatomegaly); (5) **Pathogen/treatment misclassification** (Patient 27: coagulase-negative *Strep* vs. *Staph* bacteremia; Patient 7: neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs. immunotherapy); and (6) **Contradictory outcome reporting** (Patient 28: bilirubin \"improved\" in summary vs. \"no improvement\" in fact; Patient 18: resolved fever vs. \"persistent\" claim). These inconsistencies often stem from incomplete data synthesis, terminology confusion, or failure to reconcile evolving clinical findings with initial assessments.\\n\\n## Detailed results\\n\\n### A.

All Missing Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 2, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed. Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, the specific details about adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall being taken down and removal of obstructing necrotic mass are not explicitly mentioned. While the summary does indicate that the patient underwent a \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' on 05/19/2023, and mentions a \\'necrotic small bowel mass,\\' it does not provide the specific surgical details about taking down adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall. The summary describes the procedure in general terms but lacks these specific intraoperative findings and steps. The basic procedure outcome is mentioned, but the detailed surgical steps and findings that we\\'re looking for are not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient underwent \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' on 05/19/2023. This information is found in both the \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' and \\'Problem #1: Necrotic Small Bowel Mass (Suspected Metastatic Sarcoma)\\' sections. However, the specific details about \\'adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed\\' are not explicitly mentioned in the summary. The summary does confirm that a small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed, which matches part of the fact in question.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' under therapeutic procedures for Problem #1, which matches part of the fact. However, there is no mention of \\'adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall being taken down\\' or explicit reference to an \\'obstructing necrotic mass\\' (the mass is described as \\'necrotic\\' but not labeled as \\'obstructing\\'). While the resection and anastomosis are clearly stated, the adhesion takedown and \\'obstructing\\' descriptor are absent. Thus, the full fact as defined is not explicitly present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 2, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient recovered from surgery well; had flatus and bowel movement \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary to look for mentions of post surgical bowel function (flatus and bowel movement). While the summary indicates that the patient had a successful laparoscopic small bowel resection and mentions that she was \\'tolerating diet\\' and had \\'no signs of infection or anastomotic leak,\\' it does not explicitly state whether she passed flatus or had a bowel movement. The summary describes her diet advancement and overall recovery but omits these specific details about bowel function. Even though these are typical post operative milestones that were likely monitored, they are not explicitly documented in this summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s postoperative recovery, mentioning that she \\'advanced to a regular diet\\' and was \\'tolerating oral intake\\' at discharge. While these statements imply recovery, they do not directly state that she had flatus or a bowel movement. The summary focuses on her overall clinical status, such as being afebrile and having no peritoneal signs or signs of infection/anastomotic leak, but does not explicitly mention flatus or bowel movement. Therefore, the specific fact about recovering from surgery well with flatus and bowel movement is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states that the patient underwent small bowel resection and postoperatively \\'advanced to a regular diet\\' with \\'no signs of infection or anastomotic leak.\\' While tolerating a diet implies some gastrointestinal recovery, there is no mention of flatus or bowel movements specifically. These are distinct clinical milestones in postoperative recovery that are not explicitly documented in any form (including abbreviations or synonyms) across the detailed problem based summaries or discharge notes. The absence of these specific indicators leads to the conclusion that the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 3, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** LLQ abdominal pain 2/2 cancer\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary carefully, I do not find any explicit mention of LLQ (left lower quadrant) abdominal pain due to cancer. While the summary does mention \\'cancer related pain\\' under Problem #2 and describes it as \\'chest/abdominal/bony\\' pain, it does not specifically localize any abdominal pain to the LLQ. The patient has stage IV sigmoid adenocarcinoma with metastases, which could potentially cause LLQ pain, but the specific location of abdominal pain is not explicitly stated in the summary. The pain descriptions focus mainly on right chest pain near the port site and generalized cancer related pain without specific abdominal quadrant localization.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if \\'LLQ abdominal pain 2/2 cancer\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. The summary is broken down into several sections, including a one liner, brief description of hospital course, outstanding issues/follow up, problem based summary, relevant medical history, and relevant surgical history. Upon reviewing these sections, \\'LLQ abdominal pain 2/2 cancer\\' is not directly stated. However, the summary does mention \\'Cancer related pain (chest/abdominal/bony)\\' under Problem #2, indicating the presence of abdominal pain related to cancer. The specific location \\'LLQ\\' is not mentioned, but \\'abdominal\\' pain is noted. Despite this, the fact that the pain is related to cancer is clearly stated. Thus, while the exact phrase \\'LLQ abdominal pain 2/2 cancer\\' is not present, the information regarding abdominal pain due to cancer is available.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'cancer related pain (chest/abdominal/bony)\\' in Problem #2 and lists \\'stage IV sigmoid adenocarcinoma\\' as the underlying diagnosis. While abdominal pain is noted, there is no explicit mention of left lower quadrant (LLQ) localization. The summary references metastatic disease affecting the liver, bone, and retroperitoneum, but does not specify LLQ pain as a distinct entity. Though sigmoid colon cancer typically occurs in the LLQ, the text does not directly link abdominal pain to this anatomical region. The fact requires explicit mention of LLQ localization, which is absent in all problem descriptions and imaging findings.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 4, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I searched for mentions of AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) on CKD related to urinary retention. While the summary clearly documents both CKD IV (mentioned multiple times, including in the one liner and Problem #4) and urinary retention with Foley catheter placement (detailed in Problem #2), it does not explicitly state that the patient experienced an AKI episode on top of their CKD. The renal function is actually described as \\'at baseline\\' under Problem #4, with baseline Cr noted as 3.6 3.8 mg/dL. While urinary retention was treated with Foley catheter placement, there is no indication that this was done to treat an AKI. The summary consistently refers to the patient\\'s kidney disease as CKD IV without any mention of an acute component or worsening.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient had urinary retention secondary to BPH, which was managed with Foley catheterization. The patient has a history of CKD IV, and the summary under Problem #4: CKD IV states that the patient\\'s renal function was \\'at baseline.\\' This implies that there was no significant acute deterioration mentioned elsewhere in the summary, but it does not directly state \\'AKI on CKD.\\' However, the presence of CKD IV and the context of urinary retention treated with Foley catheterization suggests that the condition could have potentially caused or contributed to an acute kidney injury (AKI) on CKD. Nonetheless, the exact phrase \\'AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement\\' is not explicitly mentioned. The summary does indicate that the patient was managed for urinary retention with Foley catheterization and that the patient has CKD IV, but it does not directly link these to an AKI event.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions urinary retention secondary to BPH managed with Foley catheter placement and tamsulosin. It documents CKD IV (baseline Cr 3.6 3.8) with nephrology follow up. However, there is no explicit mention of AKI (acute kidney injury) occurring in the context of CKD. While urinary retention (a potential cause of AKI) and CKD are both documented, the text does not state that AKI occurred or that urinary retention caused acute renal deterioration. The renal function is described as being \\'at baseline\\' throughout the summary. Therefore, while components of the fact are present, the specific diagnosis of \\'AKI on CKD\\' is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze step by step: 1. The summary mentions adrenal crisis explicitly in multiple places: One liner states \\'admitted for hypotension secondary to adrenal crisis\\' Problem #1 is titled \\'Adrenal Crisis\\' 2. The patient has primary adrenal insufficiency as part of Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome: Medical history confirms \\'Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2\\' Lists \\'primary adrenal insufficiency\\' as part of the syndrome 3. However, the summary does not explicitly state that the adrenal crisis was due to PO prednisone intolerance: While it mentions prior prednisone use (2.5mg BID) And shows transition to hydrocortisone It doesn\\'t explicitly state PO prednisone intolerance as the cause 4. The fact requires specific causation (adrenal crisis due to PO prednisone intolerance) which is not explicitly mentioned in the text, though other elements are present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course explicitly states the patient has primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2 and was admitted for adrenal crisis. However, the summary does not mention any intolerance to PO prednisone as a contributing factor. While it notes the patient\\'s chronic prednisone use (2.5 mg BID) and transition from IV to PO hydrocortisone during treatment, there is no documentation of prednisone intolerance causing the crisis. The adrenal crisis is attributed to hypotension requiring IV therapy, but the text lacks any reference to oral prednisone intolerance specifically.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary step by step: 1. The summary mentions Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) in multiple places, including the one liner and Problem #3. 2. Under Problem #3 (Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus), the summary describes insulin therapy changes: Patient was transitioned from insulin gtt (infusion) Changed to Levemir 16U BID (twice daily) 3. While insulin therapy changes are mentioned, they specifically note Levemir (not Lantus) at 16 units BID (not 15 units). 4. The specific change to \\'lantus 15 units twice a day\\' is not explicitly mentioned anywhere in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s management during the hospital stay. Under Problem #3: Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, it is mentioned that the patient was transitioned from insulin infusion to a subcutaneous insulin regimen. The specific subcutaneous insulin regimen mentioned is \\'Levemir 16U BID + lispro 1:7 AC ratio\\'. The fact we are looking for is \\'Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\' Although the patient has Type 1 diabetes, the insulin regimen at discharge was Levemir (not Lantus) 16U twice a day. Lantus and Levemir are both long acting insulin analogs, but they are not the same; however, they are often considered in the same category. The dosage mentioned in the summary (16U) is not the same as 15units. Therefore, the exact fact \\'insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states under Problem #3 (Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus) that the patient was transitioned to \\'Levemir 16U BID + lispro 1:7 AC ratio.\\' Levemir (insulin detemir) and Lantus (insulin glargine) are distinct basal insulin formulations. While both are long acting insulins, the summary explicitly specifies Levemir rather than Lantus. The dosage of 16U BID is close but not identical to 15U BID. Since the fact requires confirmation of Lantus specifically, and the text mentions Levemir instead, the exact fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 6, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Vitamin D deficiency, started on replacement, fat soluble vitamins sent, need to follow-up \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Following a step by step analysis of the hospital course summary: 1. Checked the Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section, which mentions \\'vitamin A/D/E/K/zinc/selenium/folate levels\\' under GI workup 2. Reviewed the Problem Based Summary sections for any mention of vitamin D deficiency or replacement 3. Searched for any mention of fat soluble vitamin treatment or follow up 4. While the summary indicates that fat soluble vitamin levels (including vitamin D) need to be checked as part of the GI workup, it does not explicitly state: That vitamin D deficiency was diagnosed That vitamin D replacement was started That fat soluble vitamins were sent (only that they need to be checked) Though vitamin testing is planned, the specific fact we\\'re looking for (vitamin D deficiency with replacement started) is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary mentions under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' (GI section) that \\'vitamin A/D/E/K/zinc/selenium/folate levels\\' were sent, indicating fat soluble vitamins were tested. 2. However, there is no explicit mention of Vitamin D deficiency being diagnosed in any section. 3. While fat soluble vitamin levels are listed as pending tests, the summary does not state that Vitamin D deficiency was confirmed or that replacement therapy was initiated. 4. Follow up for malabsorption evaluation is mentioned in the adrenal crisis section, but no specific follow up plan for Vitamin D deficiency management is detailed. The text implies potential concern for deficiencies but does not explicitly confirm Vitamin D deficiency or its treatment.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 7, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left renal cell carcinoma status-post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post-op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'RCC with IVC tumor thrombus (s/p neoadjuvant immunotherapy)\\' in the Relevant Medical History and \\'left radical nephrectomy with IVC thrombectomy\\' in both the one liner and surgical history. However, the summary specifies neoadjuvant immunotherapy rather than neoadjuvant chemotherapy . While the nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy are clearly documented, the neoadjuvant therapy modality discrepancy (chemotherapy vs. immunotherapy) means the exact fact as phrased (including \\'chemotherapy\\') is not explicitly stated. Immunotherapy and chemotherapy are distinct treatment modalities and not considered clinical synonyms in this context.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 7, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second-line\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of a hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo (ipilimumab/nivolumab) or a switch to cabozantinib as second line therapy. While the summary does mention immunotherapy in two places: 1) \\'Resume immunotherapy per oncology (held perioperatively)\\' in the Outstanding Issues section, and 2) \\'s/p neoadjuvant immunotherapy\\' in the Relevant Medical History section, it does not specify the type of immunotherapy or any adverse reactions. There is also no mention of cabozantinib or any treatment changes due to adverse reactions. The immunotherapy appears to have been temporarily held for surgical reasons rather than due to any hypersensitivity reaction.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention a hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo or a switch to cabozantinib as second line treatment. The summary does mention that the patient underwent neoadjuvant immunotherapy for RCC with IVC tumor thrombus, but it does not specify the type of immunotherapy or any adverse reactions to it. It also mentions resuming immunotherapy per oncology after discharge, indicating that immunotherapy was held perioperatively, but again does not specify the agents involved or any changes in the treatment regimen.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions the patient received neoadjuvant immunotherapy for renal cell carcinoma and had immunotherapy held perioperatively, with plans to resume it post discharge. However, there is no explicit mention of a hypersensitivity reaction to ipilimumab/nivolumab (ipi/nivo) or a switch to cabozantinib. The summary does not describe any adverse drug reactions, treatment changes due to toxicity, or second line therapy initiation. Cabozantinib is not referenced in any section, and the discharge plan specifies resuming immunotherapy rather than switching agents. The absence of these specific details indicates the fact is not mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 8, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Down\\'s syndrome, neurogenic bladder, admitted for pneumonia, treated with CAP regimen and vancomycin due to positive sputum culture for MRSA\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Down\\'s syndrome and neurogenic bladder are explicitly mentioned in the one liner and medical history. 2. Admission for CAP is clearly stated in the one liner. 3. The CAP regimen (ceftriaxone + azithromycin) and vancomycin are documented in the therapeutic procedures. 4. While MRSA nares PCR was positive and vancomycin was used, the sputum culture specifically showed \\'1+ Staphylococcus aureus (mixed flora)\\' without explicit confirmation of MRSA in sputum. The fact requires vancomycin use to be linked to MRSA in sputum culture, but the summary attributes MRSA positivity to nares colonization instead. Therefore, the specific causal relationship in the fact (\\'due to positive sputum culture for MRSA\\') is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I find no explicit mention of: 1) an aspiration event prior to discharge, 2) blood culture results showing 1/4 bottles positive for GPC (Gram positive cocci), or 3) pending speciation at discharge. The only blood culture information provided states \\'blood cultures (5/29) negative.\\' While the patient has a history of dysphagia s/p G tube and received treatment including pulmonary hygiene and secretion management, there is no documentation of an aspiration event. The microbiology results mentioned in the summary are limited to sputum culture showing Staphylococcus aureus with mixed flora, positive MRSA nares PCR, and urine culture results. No pending blood culture speciation is noted in the \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section or elsewhere in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, there is no mention of \\'aspiration event\\', \\'GPC (Gram Positive Cocci)\\', or \\'bottle culture\\' results. The summary discusses the patient\\'s treatment for community acquired pneumonia, improvement in condition, and various other medical issues, but does not reference any aspiration event or the specific microbiological findings mentioned in the fact. Therefore, the fact is not present in the hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) The fact requires three elements: aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles with GPC, and incomplete speciation at discharge. 2) The summary mentions dysphagia (aspiration risk) and pulmonary secretion management, but no explicit aspiration event is documented. 3) Urine culture showed Staphylococcus aureus and gram negative rods, but no reference to \\'1/4 bottles\\' or GPC (gram positive cocci) terminology. 4) While urine culture sensitivities are pending, this relates to antibiotic resistance patterns rather than speciation of GPC. The specific combination of elements in the fact (aspiration event + GPC in bottles + pending speciation) is not explicitly stated in any section of the hospital course summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis from urinary source with pyelonephritis : Explicitly stated in the \\'One Liner\\' as \\'sepsis secondary to complicated UTI/pyelonephritis.\\' 2. 7 day cipro course : Confirmed in the discharge plan under Problem #1: \\'Ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID ×7 days.\\' 3. Finasteride initiation for UTI prevention : The summary states finasteride was initiated for prostatomegaly, not explicitly for UTI. While prostatomegaly management may indirectly reduce UTI risk, the direct rationale for finasteride use in the text is anatomical (prostatomegaly), not UTI prevention. The follow up for \\'recurrent UTIs/prostatomegaly\\' links the conditions but does not explicitly state finasteride\\'s purpose as UTI prevention. Conclusion: The first two components of the fact are present, but the explicit connection between finasteride and UTI prevention is missing. A physician would likely note the absence of this specific rationale.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 9, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling, DVT US negative, unclear etiology \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of right upper extremity or left lower extremity swelling. The summary thoroughly details the patient\\'s conditions including UTI/pyelonephritis, diabetes, possible NPH, and prostatomegaly, but does not mention any extremity swelling. Additionally, there is no mention of a DVT ultrasound being performed or its results. The physical examination findings and diagnostic tests described focus on other systems and do not include any evaluation of extremity swelling. Given that this appears to be a comprehensive summary that details even minor issues in the problem based format, the absence of any mention of extremity swelling or DVT workup suggests these were not present or evaluated during this hospitalization.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was thoroughly reviewed to determine if the fact \\'Right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling, DVT US negative, unclear etiology\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary includes detailed information about the patient\\'s admission for sepsis secondary to complicated UTI/pyelonephritis, management of diabetes, evaluation for normal pressure hydrocephalus, and treatment for prostatomegaly. However, upon careful examination, there is no mention of swelling in the right upper extremity or left lower extremity, nor is there any reference to a DVT ultrasound or its results. The summary covers various aspects of the patient\\'s hospital course, including diagnostic investigations, therapeutic procedures, and discharge plans, but does not include the specific fact in question.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed systematically across all sections (One Liner, Brief Description, Outstanding Issues, Problem Based Summary, and Medical/Surgical History). No mention is made of right upper extremity or left lower extremity swelling. There is no documentation of a DVT ultrasound being performed or its results (negative or otherwise), nor is there any discussion of unclear etiology for such findings. The documented issues focus on UTI/sepsis, DM2, hydrocephalus, and prostatomegaly, with no clinical or diagnostic references to extremity swelling or vascular studies.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 10, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** The patient with polysubstance use disorder (alcohol, meth) was admitted to the hospital due to concerns for acute alcohol withdrawal and received inpatient treatment for alcohol use disorder as well as linkages to outpatient MAT treatment. \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact that \\'the patient with polysubstance use disorder (alcohol, meth) was admitted to the hospital due to concerns for acute alcohol withdrawal and received inpatient treatment for alcohol use disorder as well as linkages to outpatient MAT treatment\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. The summary indicates the patient has a history of polysubstance use disorder and was admitted for alcohol withdrawal. It mentions management with phenobarbital and lorazepam for withdrawal and initiation of naltrexone for alcohol use disorder. The Utox+ result shows ethanol and methamphetamine, confirming polysubstance use. However, the summary does not explicitly mention \\'linkages to outpatient MAT treatment.\\' It does mention \\'Addiction peer support follow up\\' and \\'Addiction Medicine follow up for residential treatment consideration,\\' which implies some form of linkage to outpatient or further treatment. Nonetheless, \\'MAT treatment\\' specifically is not mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 10, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** The patient had alcohol ketosis on presentation \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of alcohol ketosis or any equivalent terms. While the patient was admitted for alcohol withdrawal and has a history of alcohol use disorder, the summary details various complications and findings (elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, positive toxicology screen for ethanol and methamphetamine) but does not mention ketosis. The metabolic status described focuses on liver function and electrolytes, but ketone status is not addressed. The initial presentation symptoms described include tremors, anxiety, and insomnia, but not ketosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact \\'the patient had alcohol ketosis on presentation\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary, we need to carefully analyze the provided text. The summary includes sections such as \\'One Liner\\', \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\', \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\', and \\'Problem Based Summary\\'. We will look for any mention of \\'alcohol ketosis\\' or its synonyms in these sections. Upon reviewing the summary, there is no direct or indirect mention of \\'alcohol ketosis\\'. The summary discusses the patient\\'s alcohol withdrawal, alcohol use disorder, and alcohol associated cirrhosis but does not mention ketosis related to alcohol. Therefore, the fact is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention alcohol ketosis. While the patient was admitted for alcohol withdrawal and had elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT) and positive ethanol in urine tox, there is no reference to ketones in blood/urine, metabolic acidosis, or any direct clinical indicators of ketosis (e.g., anion gap calculation, bicarbonate levels). The documented electrolyte repletion could relate to various imbalances but does not specifically indicate ketosis. Alcohol ketosis is a distinct metabolic state that requires explicit mention of ketones or related metabolic parameters, which are absent in this summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 12, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was started on empiric antibiotics but was found to have a normal WBC with normal lactate and abx were discontinued, he was not discharged on antibiotics\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary looking for mentions of empiric antibiotics and their discontinuation. The summary discusses an infectious workup (\\'Infectious workup revealed no leukocytosis or fever\\') and mentions normal findings, but does not explicitly state that empiric antibiotics were started and then discontinued. While the summary mentions that there was \\'no leukocytosis\\' (matching the \\'normal WBC\\' part of the fact), and discusses monitoring for infection, it does not specifically mention the initiation, discontinuation, or absence of antibiotics at discharge. The lactate result is also not mentioned. Therefore, while some elements are similar, the specific fact about antibiotics being started and discontinued is not explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention the initiation of empiric antibiotics, the results of WBC and lactate tests, or the discontinuation of antibiotics. It does state that \\'Infectious workup revealed no leukocytosis or fever,\\' which implies that there was no significant infection or inflammatory response indicated by the absence of leukocytosis. However, it does not directly state that the patient was started on antibiotics or that they were discontinued due to normal WBC and lactate levels. The summary also does not explicitly state that the patient was not discharged on antibiotics, but it does list the discharge medications and plans, and antibiotics are not mentioned. Therefore, the specific fact about starting empiric antibiotics, finding normal WBC and lactate, discontinuing antibiotics, and not being discharged on antibiotics is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention the initiation or discontinuation of antibiotics. While it notes the absence of leukocytosis (normal WBC) in the infectious workup, there is no reference to empiric antibiotics being started, lactate levels, or a decision to stop antibiotics. The discharge plan also does not list antibiotics, but the absence of antibiotics is not explicitly stated as a deliberate action. The summary focuses on fluid management, TPN, and monitoring without addressing antibiotic use.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 12, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was discharged on TPN with instructions to follow up in 4 weeks  \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The hospital course summary indicates that the patient was discharged on TPN, as evidenced by multiple references including \\'Discharged home with home health services and TPN\\' in the Brief Description and detailed TPN plans in Problem #3. However, there is no explicit mention of a 4 week follow up instruction. The Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section lists several follow up items but does not specify a 4 week timeframe. While nutrition follow up is mentioned under Problem #3\\'s discharge plan, no specific timing is provided. Therefore, while one part of the fact (TPN at discharge) is present, the crucial 4 week follow up timing is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient was \\'Discharged home with home health services and TPN\\' under the \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' section. Additionally, in the \\'Problem Based Summary\\' under \\'Problem #3: Failure to Thrive/Malnutrition\\', it is stated that the discharge plan includes \\'Home TPN (1.4 g/kg protein, 33 kcal/kg); nutrition follow up.\\' However, the specific instruction to \\'follow up in 4 weeks\\' is not explicitly mentioned anywhere in the summary. Therefore, while discharge on TPN is confirmed, the follow up instruction is not present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient was \\'Discharged home with home health services and TPN\\' in the Brief Description section. Under Problem #3 (Failure to Thrive/Malnutrition), the Discharge Plan specifies \\'Home TPN\\' with nutrition follow up. However, the summary does NOT mention a 4 week follow up timeframe in any section. While follow up\\' is mentioned generally (e.g., \\'nutrition follow up,\\' \\'follow up imaging if symptomatic\\'), the specific 4 week interval is absent. The Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section lists TPN management but does not include timing for follow up. The 4 week timeframe in the target fact is not explicitly stated through verbatim mention, abbreviation, or equivalent clinical phrasing.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary indicates that the patient underwent a bilateral mastectomy with right axillary lymphadenectomy for stage IIIB inflammatory breast cancer. The postoperative course was complicated by several issues including pain, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and adhesive related coccyx skin blistering. Despite these complications, the patient was discharged home with stable incisions and plans for follow up care. The summary does not explicitly state that the postoperative course was \\'unremarkable\\'; instead, it lists several complications. Therefore, the fact that the patient had an \\'unremarkable post operative course\\' is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient had breast cancer and underwent bilateral mastectomy with lymphadenectomy. However, the postoperative course is described as \\'complicated\\' by multiple issues including pain requiring advanced interventions, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and skin blistering. While discharge home did occur, the phrase \\'unremarkable post operative course\\' directly contradicts the documented complications. The key element of an uneventful recovery (implied by \\'unremarkable\\') is absent, making the full fact as stated not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 13, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt has significant mental health history including anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder and did have a panic attack while admitted \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the summary for mentions of the specified mental health conditions and panic attack. Here\\'s what I found: 1. The mental health history is partially mentioned in multiple places: One liner mentions \\'bipolar disorder, PTSD\\' Relevant Medical History section lists \\'Bipolar disorder, PTSD, borderline personality disorder\\' Anxiety is not explicitly mentioned 2. There is no mention of a panic attack occurring during the admission anywhere in the summary. 3. While psychiatric follow up is mentioned as an outstanding issue \\'for bipolar/PTSD management\\', this doesn\\'t indicate a panic attack occurred. 4. The hospital course details various complications (pain, hypertension, hyperglycemia, skin reaction) but does not mention any anxiety episodes or panic attacks. Therefore, while most of the mental health history is documented, the specific fact about having a panic attack during admission is not mentioned, making this an incomplete match to the queried fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions the patient\\'s history of bipolar disorder and PTSD under \\'Relevant Medical History\\'. It also lists \\'borderline personality disorder\\' in the same section. However, there is no explicit mention of the patient having a panic attack during the admission. The summary does mention \\'Psychiatric follow up for bipolar/PTSD management\\' under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\', indicating ongoing psychiatric issues but not specifically mentioning a panic attack.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly lists \\'Bipolar disorder, PTSD, borderline personality disorder\\' in the Relevant Medical History section, covering three components of the mental health history specified in the fact. However, there is no mention of anxiety in any part of the summary. Additionally, while psychiatric follow up is noted, there is no documentation of a panic attack occurring during the admission in the postoperative complications, therapies, or problem based summaries. Since the fact requires both the listed mental health conditions (including anxiety) and a panic attack during admission, and neither anxiety nor a panic attack are explicitly stated, the full fact is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary for any explicit mention of the stability or non worsening of chronic medical conditions, particularly DM2, during the perioperative period. While the summary does mention hyperglycemia as a postoperative complication with glucose levels up to 245 mg/dL and discharge glucose of 231 mg/dL, it does not explicitly state whether this represents a significant worsening from baseline. The baseline A1c of 7.4% is noted in the medical history, and while hyperglycemia was treated with insulin sliding scale during admission, there is no explicit statement comparing this to her usual diabetic control or stating that her chronic conditions remained stable. The fact that we\\'re looking for that her chronic conditions including DM2 were not worsened perioperatively is not explicitly mentioned in the text. While we can see management of her conditions, the specific assessment of whether they worsened or remained stable is not directly addressed.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact \\'It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\' is explicitly mentioned, we need to analyze the provided hospital course summary. The summary details the patient\\'s hospital course, including the management of her chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) during the perioperative period. Under \\'Problem #4: Hyperglycemia\\', it is noted that the patient experienced hyperglycemia with glucose levels up to 245 mg/dL postoperatively and was managed with a moderate insulin sliding scale. At discharge, her glucose level was 231 mg/dL. The summary also mentions that she was to resume metformin 1g BID and continue home glucose monitoring, with a pending endocrinology follow up. The presence of hyperglycemia and the need for insulin sliding scale indicate that her DM2 was not perfectly controlled perioperatively, suggesting some level of worsening. However, the fact that she was managed with insulin and was to resume her pre admission medication (metformin) at discharge implies that her condition was being controlled. The statement in question is about whether her chronic conditions, including DM2, were worsened perioperatively. The summary indicates that there was hyperglycemia, suggesting some worsening of DM2 control. Therefore, the statement \\'It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\' is not supported because there is evidence of worsening glucose control.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly lists hyperglycemia as a postoperative complication (glucose up to 245 mg/dL) requiring insulin sliding scale and mentions resuming home metformin at discharge. While this indicates active management of DM2 during the perioperative period, there is no explicit statement that her chronic DM2 was not worsened. The text documents expected perioperative glucose fluctuations but does not specifically address whether this represented a true exacerbation of her baseline diabetic control. Other chronic conditions (hypertension, psychiatric disorders) are similarly described in their managed states without explicit commentary on perioperative worsening. The summary focuses on acute issues rather than declaring stability of chronic conditions.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 14, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Dexamethasone taper was started\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s treatment for acute lower extremity weakness due to neurofibroma related nerve compression, including the administration of dexamethasone. The \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' section under \\'Problem #1: Acute Lower Extremity Weakness\\' states that dexamethasone was transitioned from IV to oral. Furthermore, the \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' section for the same problem indicates that the patient was to continue dexamethasone 4 mg BID PO at discharge. Additionally, \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' lists \\'Adrenal insufficiency monitoring during steroid taper\\' as a pending issue, implying that a taper was planned or in progress. However, the explicit initiation of a dexamethasone taper is not directly stated in the provided text. The closest information is the transition from IV to oral dexamethasone and the mention of monitoring during steroid taper.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary in detail, there is no explicit mention of viral gastroenteritis as the principal diagnosis at discharge. While the summary describes nausea and vomiting as presenting symptoms (Problem #2), and these symptoms resolved during the admission, the etiology is not specifically attributed to viral gastroenteritis. The main focus appears to be on AKI in the setting of volume depletion, with the nausea/vomiting being treated symptomatically. The summary discusses empiric antibiotics that were discontinued after negative cultures, but does not specify a viral etiology. The discharge diagnosis appears to focus on acute tubular necrosis (\\'discharged with close nephrology follow up for presumed acute tubular necrosis\\') rather than viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' as the principal diagnosis at discharge. The summary describes the patient\\'s admission for acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to nausea/vomiting and lists several problems, including AKI, nausea/vomiting, elevated liver enzymes, and heart failure. The nausea/vomiting is attributed to various potential causes, but \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' is not mentioned. Although the patient presented with nausea and vomiting, which could be symptoms of viral gastroenteritis, the summary does not directly state this diagnosis. The differential diagnosis for nausea/vomiting included investigations like CT abdomen, which showed no acute pathology, and the treatment included antiemetics and empiric antibiotics. The discharge summary focuses on AKI and presumed acute tubular necrosis as the primary issues.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary attributes the patient\\'s AKI to volume depletion from persistent vomiting, which was treated with antiemetics and resolved. While the cause of vomiting is investigated (e.g., CT abdomen, hepatitis serologies), there is no explicit mention of \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' as the principal diagnosis. The discharge summary focuses on AKI stabilization, negative obstruction findings, and pending hepatitis results but does not state or paraphrase viral gastroenteritis as the root cause. The principal diagnosis implied throughout is AKI in the context of volume depletion, without specifying an infectious gastrointestinal etiology.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 16, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Diffuse supratentorial brain metastases with extensive vasogenic edema in bilateral parietal and occipital lobes, right greater than left, were diagnosed on MRI.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** While reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that brain metastases with vasogenic edema are mentioned multiple times, but the specific details don\\'t exactly match the fact we\\'re looking for. The summary mentions: 1. \\'Diffuse supratentorial metastases\\' (matches) 2. \\'Vasogenic edema\\' (matches) 3. Right occipital involvement (partially matches) However, the summary does not explicitly state: 1. Bilateral parietal involvement 2. The specific \\'right greater than left\\' comparison 3. The exact description of \\'extensive\\' edema in both parietal and occipital lobes While the summary does mention supratentorial metastases with vasogenic edema and right occipital involvement, it doesn\\'t provide the complete anatomical distribution described in the fact we\\'re looking for. Therefore, while related information is present, this specific fact is not explicitly mentioned in its entirety.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'diffuse supratentorial metastases\\' and \\'vasogenic edema\\' in the MRI findings under Problem #1. The largest lesion (3.4 cm) is localized to the right occipital lobe. However, the text does not specifically mention bilateral parietal lobe involvement or explicitly state \\'right greater than left\\' in the context of both parietal and occipital lobes. While \\'diffuse supratentorial\\' could imply widespread involvement, the specific anatomical details required by the fact (bilateral parietal + occipital with laterality comparison) are not fully articulated. The right occipital dominance is noted, but parietal involvement and bilateral comparison beyond the occipital focus are absent from the documentation.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 17, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Corneal ulcers and conjunctivitis requiring topical antibiotics and antifungals (vancomycin, tobramycin, and natamycin)\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course explicitly mentions bilateral corneal ulcers and details the use of topical vancomycin, tobramycin, and natamycin eye drops. However, conjunctivitis is not mentioned in any part of the summary. While the medications listed (vancomycin, tobramycin as antibiotics; natamycin as an antifungal) align with the fact\\'s treatment components, the absence of any reference to conjunctivitis (or equivalent terms) means the full fact (corneal ulcers AND conjunctivitis requiring these medications) is not explicitly stated. The summary addresses corneal ulcers alone with this therapy.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 17, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, coupled with ketosis secondary to probable starvation and alcohol use\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze this step by step: 1. The summary mentions hypokalemia (K+ 2.6) and hypomagnesemia explicitly in multiple places: Brief description section mentions both conditions Problem #3 is specifically dedicated to these electrolyte abnormalities 2. Regarding ketosis and starvation: While the patient has alcohol use disorder and was in withdrawal There is NO explicit mention of ketosis There is NO explicit mention of starvation 3. While we might clinically suspect that ketosis and starvation could have contributed to the electrolyte abnormalities given the patient\\'s alcohol use disorder, this specific connection is not explicitly stated in the summary. 4. The cause of the electrolyte abnormalities is not explicitly attributed to any specific factor in the text. Therefore, while the hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia are clearly documented, the complete fact including ketosis secondary to starvation and alcohol use is not fully present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly mentions hypokalemia (K+ 2.6) and hypomagnesemia (Mg 1.6) in both the Brief Description and Problem #3 sections, confirming the first part of the fact. 2. The phrase \\'coupled with ketosis secondary to probable starvation and alcohol use\\' is not addressed. While alcohol use is documented as a key factor in the patient\\'s presentation, there is no mention of ketosis, starvation, or any lab/clinical findings (e.g., anion gap acidosis, ketonuria) supporting this metabolic state. 3. The electrolyte disturbances are attributed to repletion needs in the documentation, but no causal link to starvation or ketosis is established. Alcohol use is cited in the context of withdrawal management, not as a direct contributor to ketosis in this summary. 4. Since ketosis and its proposed etiology (starvation + alcohol) are absent from all sections of the hospital course, the full fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, the fact is not explicitly mentioned. While the patient did present with fever (38.2°C), several key elements differ from the specified fact: 1. The fever resolved by hospital day 3 with antibiotics, rather than being persistent 2. While there was a negative infectious workup (negative blood cultures, procalcitonin 0.09, normal CT abdomen/pelvis, and CXR), there was no specific mention of suspected pulmonary infection 3. The CXR only showed bibasilar atelectasis, and while a CT chest was pending at discharge, there was no documented suspicion of pulmonary infection 4. The fever resolved with treatment, contradicting the concept of persistence despite workup The clinical scenario described shows a fever that responded to empiric treatment rather than a persistent fever with suspected pulmonary source despite negative workups.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details a patient admitted for non neutropenic fever following high dose methotrexate therapy. The patient presented with fever (38.2°C) without localizing symptoms. Initial workup, including blood cultures, procalcitonin, CT abdomen/pelvis, and CXR, showed no infectious source. The patient received empiric antibiotics and became afebrile by hospital day 3. The summary highlights that the initial infectious workup was negative. Although a CT chest was pending at discharge, the initial CXR showed bibasilar atelectasis, which could be suggestive of a pulmonary issue. The fact \\'Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\' is not explicitly mentioned because the fever did not persist; it resolved by hospital day 3. While there is a mention of pending CT chest and initial atelectasis on CXR, the overall context does not clearly indicate a \\'suspected pulmonary infection\\' as the fever resolved and the patient was afebrile at discharge.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary describes a non neutropenic fever that resolved by hospital day 3 with empiric antibiotics. While infectious workups (blood cultures, procalcitonin, CT abdomen/pelvis, CXR) were negative, there is no mention of a \\'suspected pulmonary infection\\' in the text. The CXR finding was bibasilar atelectasis (not infectious), and the pending CT chest is listed without clinical suspicion for pulmonary infection. The fever resolved quickly and is not described as persistent beyond initial presentation. Though negative infectious workups are documented, the combination of \\'persistent fever\\' and \\'suspected pulmonary infection\\' as a unified clinical concern is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 20, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, while CBC monitoring is mentioned, the specific frequency of \\'twice weekly\\' CBCs after discharge is not explicitly stated. The summary only mentions \\'Monitor CBC weekly\\' under Problem #2 (Thrombocytopenia) in the discharge plan and \\'Follow up CBC\\' in the Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section. The frequency specified is weekly, not twice weekly as we\\'re looking for.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if the fact \\'Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\' is explicitly mentioned. Under \\'Problem #2: Thrombocytopenia (ITP vs. Secondary Causes)\\', the \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' section states \\'Monitor CBC weekly.\\' This indicates that CBC monitoring is planned once a week after discharge, not twice weekly. Therefore, the specific fact of ordering \\'twice weekly CBCs\\' is not mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions under Problem #2 (Thrombocytopenia) in the Discharge Plan and Goals: \\'Monitor CBC weekly.\\' The specific instruction is for weekly CBC monitoring, not twice weekly. While follow up CBCs are mentioned in the Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section, no frequency is specified there. The term \\'twice weekly\\' does not appear in any form (e.g., \\'2x/week,\\' \\'every 3 4 days,\\' or synonyms) in the summary. The documented frequency of \\'weekly\\' directly contradicts the requested fact of \\'twice weekly,\\' making this a clear absence.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, while recurrent falls are mentioned multiple times, there is no explicit indication that their etiology remained unknown despite extensive workup. In fact, several potential contributing factors are identified: 1) The patient has dementia with hospital delirium, 2) NSVT episodes were detected on cardiac monitoring, 3) The patient has HFrEF, and 4) The patient has functional decline. The falls are being addressed with specific interventions (PT/OT, TLSO bracing, walker use), suggesting some understanding of contributing factors rather than an unknown etiology. The summary does not state or imply that the falls\\' cause remained a mystery after workup.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states \\'recurrent falls\\' as a primary admission reason and details multiple investigations (CT spine, telemetry, cardiac monitoring) and interventions (PT/OT, pacemaker adjustments). However, the summary does not explicitly state that the etiology remains unknown despite workup. Instead, it identifies contributing factors (NSVT episodes, dementia related decline) and documents specific management changes (metoprolol escalation, delirium precautions). While the root cause may not be fully resolved, the text does not use phrasing indicating \\'unknown etiology\\' or equivalent terminology, and instead describes identified contributors to falls.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention that the T6 wedge compression fracture likely occurred before the most recent fall. While the summary does mention a T6 wedge compression fracture multiple times (in the one liner, brief description, and Problem #2), it\\'s described as \\'new\\' and \\'interval\\' when compared to 2021 imaging. The text specifically states \\'CT spine: New T6 wedge compression fracture vs 2021 imaging\\' and \\'CT chest: Interval T6 compression deformity\\'. These descriptions suggest the fracture was discovered after the recent falls and is being characterized as a new finding, rather than a pre existing condition from before the most recent fall. The temporal relationship suggesting the fracture predated the most recent fall is not mentioned anywhere in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions a \\'new T6 wedge compression fracture\\' in the context of the patient\\'s recent falls. However, it does not directly state whether this fracture occurred before or after the most recent fall. The summary does compare the current CT spine findings to 2021 imaging, suggesting the fracture is being evaluated for chronicity. Nonetheless, the text does not explicitly state that the T6 wedge compression fracture happened before the most recent fall. It implies the fracture is \\'new,\\' which could suggest it occurred around the time of or after the recent falls. The fact that it is compared to 2021 imaging implies there was a previous assessment, but the summary does not directly state the timing relative to the most recent fall.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states the T6 compression fracture is \\'subacute\\' and \\'new\\' compared to 2021 imaging. While \\'subacute\\' suggests the fracture occurred days to weeks prior, the summary does not mention any temporal relationship between the fracture and the \\'most recent fall\\' specifically. The documentation only links the fracture to \\'multiple falls\\' generally, and does not explicitly state that the fracture predates the most recent fall. The absence of direct temporal clarification regarding the fracture\\'s timing relative to the latest fall meets the criteria for 0.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention that Augmentin therapy should be continued and re evaluated prior to a 14 day completion. While the summary does mention antibiotic therapy (specifically IV Zosyn during admission and \\'oral antibiotics\\' at discharge), and notes that final culture sensitivities are pending to guide antibiotic therapy, it does not specifically mention Augmentin or a 14 day course. The only antibiotic related follow up mentioned is regarding checking final blood/wound culture sensitivities to guide therapy. The specific recommendation about continuing and re evaluating Augmentin therapy before a 14 day completion is not present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if the fact \\'should continue and re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary indicates that the patient was discharged on oral antibiotics, and it is mentioned that the antibiotic therapy should be culture directed. However, the specific mention of \\'Augmentin\\' or the need to re evaluate its continuation before 14 days is not found in the provided text. The summary does mention \\'Final blood/wound culture sensitivities pending\\' as an outstanding issue, which implies that the antibiotic therapy might need adjustment based on culture results, but it does not directly state the fact in question.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention Augmentin (amoxicillin clavulanate) or any equivalent antibiotic in the discharge plan or therapeutic interventions. While it states \\'continue oral antibiotics (culture directed)\\' and notes that final culture sensitivities are pending, the specific instruction to \\'continue and re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\' is absent. The initial antibiotic used was Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam), and the discharge plan refers to oral antibiotics generically without naming Augmentin. The re evaluation mentioned relates to pending sensitivities but does not specify a 14 day course adjustment for Augmentin.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 22, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** patient should follow up with Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/ Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Poultsides, George, MD in in 2 weeks\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, including the Brief Description, Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section, and all Problem Based summaries, there is no explicit mention of follow up appointments with either an Advanced Practice Provider in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides, George, MD in 2 weeks. While the summary does mention several follow up items (including radiation oncology consultation, outpatient nutrition follow up, and biliary drain monitoring), it does not specify these particular provider appointments or their timing. The only follow up appointments mentioned are more general in nature, without specific providers or timeframes being identified.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, treatment, and discharge plan. To determine if the specific fact about follow up appointments is mentioned, we need to look for any reference to follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider (APP) or Dr. Poultsides, George, MD. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section and \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' sections under each problem are relevant. However, upon reviewing these sections, there is no explicit mention of a follow up with an APP in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. The summary does mention various follow ups such as radiation oncology consultation for SBRT, outpatient nutrition follow up, and monitoring biliary drain output, but it does not specify the requested follow up details.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention follow up appointments with an Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant) in 1 week or Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists general follow up categories (e.g., radiation oncology consultation, nutrition follow up) but does not specify providers or exact timelines. The discharge plans under each problem mention outpatient follow up for SBRT planning, nutrition, and drain monitoring, but again without naming specific clinicians or stating the 1 week/2 week intervals. While Dr. Poultsides is listed in the fact to check, his name does not appear anywhere in the provided summary. No APP follow up timeframe is documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 23, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. The summary is divided into sections, including a one liner, brief description of hospital course, outstanding issues/follow up, and problem based summary. The one liner mentions the patient\\'s history of Rai Stage II CLL and bioprosthetic aortic/mitral valve replacements. The problem based summary includes sections on Rai Stage II CLL with leukocytosis and valvular heart disease (severe mitral stenosis), indicating that both CLL and mitral valvulopathy are relevant to the patient\\'s condition. Although the summary does not explicitly state \\'in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\' as a single phrase, it provides detailed information about both conditions and their management during the hospital stay. The CLL is noted to be Rai Stage II and the patient is undergoing treatment for it, and the mitral valvulopathy is discussed in terms of severe mitral stenosis with a gradient of 25 mmHg on recent TTE. Thus, while the exact phrase is not used, the context of both progressing CLL (implied by the ongoing treatment and leukocytosis on admission) and mitral valvulopathy (severe mitral stenosis) is present throughout the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. CLL Progression Analysis : The summary documents Rai Stage II CLL with leukocytosis (WBC 477K) and ongoing treatment (obinutuzumab/duvelisib), but does not explicitly state that the CLL is \\'progressing.\\' While leukocytosis and treatment suggest active disease, the term \\'progressing\\' or equivalent phrasing (e.g., \\'worsening,\\' \\'advancing\\') is absent. 2. Mitral Valvulopathy Analysis : Severe mitral stenosis (gradient 25 mmHg) is explicitly documented, which qualifies as mitral valvulopathy. 3. Combined Fact Check : The required fact specifies both \\'progressing CLL\\' and \\'mitral valvulopathy.\\' While mitral valvulopathy is clearly present, the lack of explicit evidence for \\'progressing\\' CLL (despite high WBC and treatment) means the full fact is not stated. A busy physician would note the absence of progression terminology for CLL.\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 23, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find any explicit mention of cardiology coordinating follow up with the Heart Failure team or any discussion of transcatheter MVR or a new clinical trial drug in 4/2023. While the summary does mention cardiology consultation and notes that valve intervention evaluation may be needed if the gradient remains elevated (under Problem #3), it does not specify the type of intervention or mention any clinical trial. The only follow up mentioned regarding the valve issues is a repeat TTE outpatient. The specific details about Heart Failure team coordination, transcatheter MVR, and a clinical trial drug for 4/2023 are not present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention the fact \\'Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\'. The summary does mention \\'Cardiology consultation\\' under Problem #3: Valvular Heart Disease and indicates a need for \\'valve intervention evaluation if gradient remains elevated\\', but it does not specify any plans for transcatheter MVR or discussion of a new clinical trial drug.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions cardiology consultation and plans for repeat TTE to assess mitral valve gradients, with a pending need for valve intervention evaluation if gradients remain elevated. However, there is no explicit mention of cardiology coordinating follow up with the Heart Failure team, transcatheter MVR, or a new clinical trial drug from 4/2023. While valve intervention is discussed in general terms, the specific details in the fact (Heart Failure team involvement, transcatheter approach, or clinical trial drug) are not stated in any form.\\n\\n\\n\\n**34. Patient 24, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary for explicit mention of discharge on full liquid diet and oral pain medications. Here\\'s what I found: 1. Full liquid diet: This is explicitly mentioned in multiple places: \\'He was advanced to full liquids with nutritional support and discharged\\' \\'Current Clinical Status: SBO resolved; tolerating full liquids\\' \\'Initiated full liquids, Ensure Enlive supplements\\' 2. Oral pain medications: There is no explicit mention of discharge pain medications in the summary. While medications are mentioned (ondansetron, metoclopramide), these are anti nausea medications, not pain medications. Since only one part of the fact (full liquid diet) is mentioned but the other part (oral pain medications) is not, this does not fully match the fact we\\'re looking for.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary indicates that the patient was \\'advanced to full liquids\\' and had \\'nutritional support\\' during the admission. Upon discharge, the plan included \\'advance diet as tolerated\\' and \\'oral supplements.\\' The \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' under \\'Problem #1: Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO)\\' mentions that the patient was \\'tolerating full liquids.\\' Additionally, under \\'Problem #3: Malnutrition,\\' it is stated that the patient was on \\'full liquids\\' with \\'Ensure Enlive supplements.\\' While the summary does not explicitly state \\'discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications,\\' it implies the patient was on a full liquid diet at discharge. However, there is no explicit mention of \\'oral pain medications.\\' The medications listed include \\'Ondansetron, metoclopramide PRN,\\' which are not typically classified as pain medications.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly states under \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' that the patient was \\'advanced to full liquids with nutritional support and discharged.\\' This directly confirms the \\'full liquid diet\\' component. 2. The discharge plan in Problem #1 lists \\'Ondansetron, metoclopramide PRN\\' as medications, which are antiemetics/prokinetics, not pain medications. No oral analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, opioids) are mentioned in any section of the discharge plan or therapeutic interventions. While pain management might be implied given the clinical context, the specific mention of oral pain medications is absent from the documentation provided.\\n\\n\\n\\n**35. Patient 25, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Step 1: I searched the summary for mentions of GI series and related findings. Step 2: Found in Problem #6 (Duodenitis/Gastric Distention): \\'Upper GI series (01/13/2024): No mechanical obstruction\\' NGT decompression and PPI therapy mentioned GI consultation discussed in Problem #7 Step 3: While some elements match (GI series showing no obstruction, PPI therapy), the specific details about GI/advanced GI consultation deferring EGD/ERCP and recommending empiric PPI for 8 weeks are not explicitly stated. The summary mentions GI consultation but for different purposes (ERCP for CBD stricture). Step 4: The famotidine to PPI transition specifics are not mentioned, though PPI use is noted. Conclusion: While there is overlap in some elements, the specific combination of findings and recommendations in the target fact is not fully present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. The summary contains information about an Upper GI series performed on 01/13/2024, which showed \\'No mechanical obstruction.\\' This matches the first part of the fact. Additionally, the summary mentions that the patient was managed with IV PPI transitioning to oral PPI, aligning with the mention of PPI in the fact. However, the specific details about famotidine, the exact discussion with GI specialists, and the recommendation for empiric PPI for 8 weeks are not directly stated in the summary. Despite this, key elements of the fact are present, such as the Upper GI series result and the use of PPI.\\n\\n\\n\\n**36. Patient 25, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) on admission or its treatment with fluids and resolution. While the summary mentions various complications and problems (numbered 1 7), kidney function issues are not listed among them. The summary includes detailed information about fluid management in other contexts (like paracentesis and diuretics for ascites), but does not specifically mention AKI. The laboratory monitoring section mentions BMP (Basic Metabolic Panel) monitoring, which would include kidney function, but there\\'s no indication this was for AKI management. Therefore, while the patient may have received fluids during their stay, there is no explicit mention of AKI diagnosis, treatment, or resolution.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved.\\' To determine this, I reviewed the provided summary, focusing on sections that could potentially mention acute kidney injury (AKI), fluid treatment, or related conditions. The \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' and \\'Problem Based Summary\\' sections were thoroughly examined. While the summary details various complications and treatments, such as diuretic use and electrolyte management, there is no direct mention of AKI or its treatment with fluids. The closest relevant information is the mention of \\'diuretics\\' and \\'electrolyte management,\\' but these do not directly imply AKI treatment with fluids. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed systematically. AKI (acute kidney injury) is not mentioned in any section, including the problem list, diagnostics, therapeutics, or discharge plans. While electrolyte management and BMP monitoring are noted, these are not specific to AKI. Fluid management is mentioned in the context of paracentesis and duodenitis (NGT decompression), but there\\'s no indication fluids were given specifically for AKI treatment. No resolution of AKI is documented. The absence of any direct reference to AKI, its treatment, or resolution meets criteria for 0.\\n\\n\\n\\n**37. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. The summary mentions that the patient had \\'acute epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting\\' and that CT angiography identified \\'chronic SMA stenosis.\\' However, it does not directly link the patient\\'s emesis to chronic mesenteric ischemia. The summary states that abdominal imaging \\'ruled out acute ischemia\\' but identified \\'chronic SMA stenosis.\\' While the presence of chronic SMA stenosis is noted, there is no explicit statement connecting it to the patient\\'s emesis. The closest relevant information is under \\'Problem #1: Hypovolemia with Atrial Flutter/RVR\\' where it is mentioned that CT angiography showed \\'Moderate SMA stenosis (no acute ischemia).\\' Despite this, the summary does not make a clear connection between the SMA stenosis and the patient\\'s symptoms like emesis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions CT angiography showing \\'moderate SMA stenosis\\' in Problem #1 and notes \\'chronic SMA stenosis\\' was identified in the Brief Description. However, there is no explicit statement linking the patient\\'s emesis (vomiting) to chronic mesenteric ischemia or SMA stenosis. The vomiting is attributed to gastroenteritis/gastroparesis exacerbation in Problem #2, and while SMA stenosis is documented as a finding, no causal relationship with emesis is established in the text. A busy physician would not find a direct statement or paraphrase connecting these elements.\\n\\n\\n\\n**38. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient was admitted for neutropenic fever, matching the first part of the fact. 2. The bacteremia is identified as coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CoNS), not Streptococcus. While \\'coagulase negative staph\\' and \\'coagulase negative strep\\' are both gram positive bacteria, they are distinct organisms (Staphylococcus vs. Streptococcus), and no mention of Streptococcus appears in the text. 3. PICC removal/replacement is explicitly documented (removed 3/5, reinsertion planned post discharge). 4. Antibiotic treatment (vancomycin, linezolid) is clearly described. The critical discrepancy is the bacterial genus: the fact specifies \\'strep,\\' but the summary identifies \\'Staphylococcus.\\' Since these are not clinical synonyms, the fact as stated is not fully present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**39. Patient 27, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, under \\'Problem #1: Neutropenic Fever with Coagulase Negative Staphylococcal Bacteremia\\', it is stated that \\'TTE: No vegetations (LVEF 64%)\\'. The date of the TTE is not explicitly mentioned in the summary. However, the information about the absence of vegetations is present. The exact date \\'3/6/23\\' is not found, but the fact that TTE showed no vegetations is mentioned. The presence of \\'mass\\' is not directly addressed, but the absence of \\'vegetations\\' is the critical piece of information related to the original fact. Therefore, while the exact date is not mentioned, the relevant clinical finding is present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions a TTE result under Problem #1 (Neutropenic Fever) in the \\'Key Investigations\\' section, stating \\'TTE: No vegetations (LVEF 64%)\\'. This matches the critical component of the fact (\\'w/o evidence of mass or vegetations\\'). However, the summary does not specify the date of the TTE as 3/6/23. While the TTE was likely performed during the admission (which included dates around early March 2023), the exact date is not documented in the provided text. Since the date is part of the fact being queried and is not explicitly stated, the full fact as phrased (\\'TTE on 3/6/23...\\') is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**40. Patient 28, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After analyzing the hospital course summary, I find that while the patient was admitted for biliary obstruction and hyperbilirubinemia, and did have PTBD exchanges, the specific date of 4/21/23 for a PTBD exchange is not mentioned. The summary lists PTBD exchanges on 03/25/2023 and 04/08/2023, but not on 04/21/23. While the patient\\'s condition matches (recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchanges), the specific date in question is not documented in the provided summary. The most recent PTBD intervention mentioned was an upsizing to 16 Fr on 04/08/2023.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. The summary indicates the patient was admitted for biliary obstruction, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypotension in the setting of recurrent intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. It mentions that the patient underwent IR guided percutaneous biliary drain exchanges and that previous PTBD placements and exchanges occurred on 03/17/2023, 03/25/2023, and 04/08/2023. However, there is no mention of a PTBD exchange on 4/21/23. The closest date mentioned is 04/08/2023, which is prior to the specified date. Therefore, the specific fact regarding the PTBD exchange on 4/21/23 is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions recurrent malignant biliary obstruction and hyperbilirubinemia, which aligns with the first two components of the fact. However, the summary does not document a PTBD exchange occurring on 4/21/23. The documented PTBD exchanges occurred on 03/25/2023 and 04/08/2023, with stent upsizing on 04/08/2023. The discharge plan references future exchanges in 2 3 months, but no exchange on 4/21/23 is mentioned. Since the specific date (4/21/23) for the PTBD exchange is a critical part of the fact and is absent from the summary, the fact as stated is not fully present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**41. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After analyzing the hospital course summary, the stated fact is not explicitly mentioned. While the summary does indicate that the patient was transitioned to home hospice and had biliary drain management, the specific detail about \\'bilirubin not improving despite PTBD exchange\\' is contradicted by the text. The summary actually states that \\'Bilirubin trended downward to 10.8 mg/dL\\' from a peak of 19 mg/dL, indicating improvement. Additionally, under Problem #1, it confirms \\'T bili improved to 10.8 mg/dL at discharge.\\' The transition to hospice appears to be related to overall clinical deterioration (including delirium and worsening renal function) rather than failing biliary drainage. Therefore, since the specific fact about bilirubin not improving despite PTBD exchange is not mentioned and is actually contradicted by the documented improvement in bilirubin, this fact cannot be considered present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary indicates that the patient\\'s bilirubin level initially was high (peak T bili 19 mg/dL) but trended downward to 10.8 mg/dL after undergoing IR guided percutaneous biliary drain exchanges. This shows that bilirubin did improve after the PTBD exchange. The summary also mentions that after goals of care discussions, the patient was transitioned to home hospice with ongoing biliary drain management. Thus, the fact that \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange\\' is not supported because the summary explicitly states that bilirubin trended downward. However, the fact that \\'pt/family opted to transition to home hospice\\' is mentioned. Therefore, the specific fact is partially incorrect regarding bilirubin improvement but correct regarding the transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary states that after PTBD exchanges (including upsizing to 16 Fr), bilirubin \\'trended downward to 10.8 mg/dL\\' from a peak of 19 mg/dL, indicating improvement. 2. While the transition to home hospice is documented, this decision is attributed to \\'persistent delirium and worsening renal function\\' following goals of care discussions, not specifically to a lack of bilirubin improvement. 3. The summary explicitly shows bilirubin DID improve with PTBD exchange, contradicting the first part of the target fact. The hospice transition reason is present but not linked to bilirubin response.\\n\\n\\n\\n**42. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze each component of the fact against the hospital course summary: 1. Sepsis requiring antibiotics and fluid resuscitation: The summary mentions elevated WBC (18.9 K/uL), IV antibiotics (piperacillin tazobactam), and IV fluid resuscitation for hypotension While \\'sepsis\\' isn\\'t explicitly stated, the combination of antibiotics, elevated WBC, and fluid resuscitation strongly suggests it 2. Delirium requiring pharmacotherapy: Delirium is explicitly mentioned in multiple places However, pharmacotherapy for delirium is not mentioned (only sitter, restraints, and family education noted) 3. Urinary retention requiring catheter: No mention of urinary retention or catheter placement anywhere in the summary While some elements are present (infection treatment, delirium), the exact combination of all three complications (sepsis + delirium with pharmacotherapy + urinary retention with catheter) is not fully and explicitly stated as described in the fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s admission for biliary obstruction, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypotension. The summary is broken down into sections including a brief description of the hospital course and problem based summaries. The key fact to determine is whether the hospital course was complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter. Upon reviewing the summary, it is evident that the patient received IV antibiotics (piperacillin tazobactam) for recurrent cholangitis and underwent IV fluid resuscitation for dehydration/hypotension, indicating treatment for sepsis like conditions. The patient also developed delirium, for which sitter, restraints, and family education were implemented, though specific pharmacotherapy is not mentioned. However, the summary does not explicitly mention urinary retention or the use of a urinary catheter. Thus, while some components of the fact are mentioned (antibiotics for suspected infection and fluid resuscitation), the absence of explicit mention of urinary retention and pharmacotherapy for delirium means the fact is not fully represented.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis requiring antibiotics : The summary mentions \\'recurrent cholangitis\\' treated with IV piperacillin tazobactam. While sepsis is not explicitly named, cholangitis with antibiotic use meets the threshold for clinical equivalence. 2. Aggressive fluid resuscitation : Documented under Problem #3 as \\'IV fluid resuscitation (NS bolus, D5NS at 150 mL/hr)\\', which qualifies as aggressive fluid management. 3. Delirium requiring pharmacotherapy : Delirium is noted, but only non pharmacologic interventions (sitter, restraints) are described. No mention of medications (e.g., antipsychotics) for delirium. 4. Urinary retention requiring catheter : No reference to urinary retention or catheter placement in any section. While two components (sepsis/antibiotics and fluids) are present, urinary retention and pharmacologic delirium management are absent. Since the fact requires all three complications to be explicitly mentioned, the answer is 0.\\n\\n\\n\\n**43. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, while the text mentions the patient\\'s nasopharyngeal carcinoma and delirium as separate issues (Problem #1 and Problem #4), it does not explicitly state that management of the metastatic cancer was deferred to outpatient oncology due to the son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium. The summary does indicate outpatient oncology follow up is planned (\\'Discharge Plan: Outpatient oncology follow up for treatment planning\\' under Problem #1), but it does not specify this was due to the son\\'s wishes or the patient\\'s delirium. The patient\\'s delirium is documented as a separate issue (Problem #4), but its impact on cancer management decisions is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, while related elements are present, this specific fact about deferring management due to these particular reasons is not explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission and management. The key fact to determine is whether the management of the patient\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was deferred to an outpatient oncologist per the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and the patient\\'s delirium. The summary indicates that the patient had nasopharyngeal carcinoma (T4) with cervical metastases and that there was a plan for outpatient oncology follow up for treatment planning. However, it does not explicitly mention that the decision to defer management was made per the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes. It does mention the patient\\'s delirium, which was managed during the hospital stay. The discharge plan includes outpatient oncology follow up, which implies deferral of further management to the outpatient setting.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states under Problem #1 (Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma) that the discharge plan includes \\'Outpatient oncology follow up for treatment planning.\\' While delirium is documented in Problem #4 and caregiver involvement is implied in the discharge plan for delirium monitoring, there is no explicit mention of deferring management decisions to the outpatient oncologist specifically due to the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes or the patient\\'s delirium. The text indicates outpatient follow up is planned but does not attribute this decision to family preferences or delirium as causative factors.\\n\\n\\n\\n**44. Patient 29, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that while aspiration risk and NPO status are mentioned, the specific fact about developing a temporary O2 requirement due to aspiration pneumonitis is not explicitly stated. The summary mentions \\'aspiration concerns\\' and notes that SLP evaluation showed \\'Silent aspiration risk, strict NPO\\' under Problem #2, but it does not specifically describe an episode where the patient developed an oxygen requirement due to aspiration pneumonitis. While aspiration risk was clearly a concern in the patient\\'s care, the specific complication and its direct consequence (O2 requirement) are not documented in this summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if the fact \\'Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary was broken down into sections and scrutinized for relevant information. Under \\'Problem #2: Failure to Thrive/Dysphagia\\', it is mentioned that the SLP evaluation resulted in the patient being made \\'strict NPO\\' due to \\'silent aspiration risk\\'. Although the summary does not explicitly mention \\'aspiration pneumonitis\\' or a \\'temporary O2 requirement\\', it does confirm the SLP evaluation and the \\'strict NPO\\' status. The presence of \\'aspiration concerns\\' under the \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' section further supports the relevance of aspiration risk. Thus, while the exact phrase \\'temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis\\' is not present, the critical elements of \\'aspiration risk\\' and \\'strict NPO by SLP\\' are mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states that SLP evaluation led to \\'strict NPO\\' status due to silent aspiration risk (Problem #2). However, there is no mention of a temporary oxygen requirement or any respiratory complication (e.g., aspiration pneumonitis) in the entire summary. While \\'aspiration concerns\\' are noted in the Brief Description, this does not equate to an explicit statement about oxygen needs or pneumonitis. The resolved issues and problem lists focus on metabolic acidosis, delirium, and dysphagia management without referencing respiratory support or pneumonitis.\\n\\n\\n\\n### B.

All Inconsistent Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 2, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed. Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down\\' during surgery. 2. Hospital Summary explicitly lists only \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' under therapeutic procedures. 3. No mention of adhesion lysis or omental involvement in the surgical description. 4. These are distinct procedural elements that cannot both be true if one is omitted. 5. Direct contradiction exists between the scope of procedures described.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 4, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The fact states \\'AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention\\', but the summary only mentions CKD IV without any acute kidney injury 2. The summary specifically states \\'At baseline renal function\\' under Problem #4: CKD IV 3. The summary shows stable creatinine at baseline of 3.6 3.8 mg/dL 4. While the urinary retention and foley placement are mentioned, there\\'s no indication of any acute worsening of kidney function 5. This represents a clear contradiction as the summary indicates stable CKD without AKI, while the fact claims AKI was present\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states AKI on CKD due to urinary retention treated with Foley. 2. Hospital Summary documents CKD IV (baseline Cr 3.6 3.8) but never mentions AKI. 3. Problem #4 (CKD IV) explicitly states \\'current status: at baseline renal function,\\' contradicting the presence of AKI. 4. Foley was used for urinary retention/BPH management, but no AKI is described as being treated or present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states the patient was on Levemir 16U BID (twice daily), not Lantus 15U BID. 2. While both are long acting insulin analogs, they are different medications. 3. The dose is also different (16 units vs 15 units). 4. This represents a clear factual contradiction in both the medication type and dosage.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that the patient was transitioned to \\'Levemir 16U BID + lispro 1:7 AC ratio\\' for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus management. The Important Fact mentions that insulin was changed to \\'lantus 15units twice a day\\'. Lantus and Levemir are both long acting insulins, but they are not the same. Lantus is insulin glargine, while Levemir is insulin detemir. Therefore, the type of insulin and dosage mentioned in the summary and the fact are different, indicating a contradiction.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states insulin changed to Lantus 15U BID. 2. Hospital Summary (Problem #3) documents insulin regimen as Levemir 16U BID + lispro. 3. Lantus (glargine) and Levemir (detemir) are distinct basal insulins with different dosing frequencies. 4. Summary specifies Levemir brand/dose without mentioning Lantus, directly contradicting the stated fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 6, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Vitamin D deficiency, started on replacement, fat soluble vitamins sent, need to follow-up \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions GI workup including vitamin A/D/E/K levels as pending/outstanding issues (#3 under Outstanding Issues/Follow Up) 2. However, the summary does not indicate that Vitamin D deficiency was diagnosed or that replacement was started 3. No mention of fat soluble vitamins being sent or initiated 4. The summary only indicates these tests are planned for future follow up, not that they were completed or acted upon during the admission\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states Vitamin D deficiency was diagnosed and replacement started. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s \\'Outstanding Issues\\' lists pending \\'vitamin A/D/E/K/zinc/selenium/folate levels\\' under GI workup, indicating these labs were not yet resulted. 3. No documentation of Vitamin D replacement being administered during admission in therapeutic sections. 4. Summary\\'s malabsorption evaluation is pending, while Fact implies replacement was already initiated. These elements conflict as replacement therapy would typically follow confirmed deficiency.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 7, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left renal cell carcinoma status-post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post-op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy. \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states the patient had \\'Left renal cell carcinoma status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy.\\' The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient underwent \\'left radical nephrectomy with IVC thrombectomy for renal cell carcinoma\\' and had \\'RCC with IVC tumor thrombus (s/p neoadjuvant immunotherapy)\\'. The discrepancy lies in the type of neoadjuvant therapy mentioned: \\'chemotherapy\\' in the Important Fact versus \\'immunotherapy\\' in the Hospital Course Summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\' was given. 2. Hospital Summary states \\'s/p neoadjuvant immunotherapy\\' in Relevant Medical History. 3. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy are distinct treatment modalities. 4. Both cannot be true simultaneously for the same treatment phase.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 7, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second-line\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo led to switch to cabozantinib. 2. Hospital Summary states \\'Resume immunotherapy per oncology (held perioperatively)\\' under Outstanding Issues. 3. No mention of hypersensitivity reaction or treatment change in the entire summary. 4. Direct contradiction between planned resumption of immunotherapy (implying continued use) vs. fact stating it was discontinued due to reaction. Both cannot be true.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 7, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Continued on apixaban post-op\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'Continued on apixaban post op\\'. 2. Hospital summary\\'s Outstanding Issues list \\'Restart apixaban for DVT prophylaxis\\'. 3. \\'Restart\\' implies temporary discontinuation during perioperative period, conflicting with \\'continued\\' (no interruption). 4. No documentation of uninterrupted apixaban use in summary sections.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 8, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Down\\'s syndrome, neurogenic bladder, admitted for pneumonia, treated with CAP regimen and vancomycin due to positive sputum culture for MRSA\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states sputum culture was positive for MRSA, but Hospital Summary\\'s sputum culture result lists \\'1+ Staphylococcus aureus (mixed flora)\\' without specifying MRSA. 2. MRSA nares PCR was positive, but this indicates colonization, not sputum confirmed MRSA pneumonia. 3. Vancomycin use aligns with nares colonization, but the stated reason (sputum MRSA) conflicts with the documented culture results.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions that the patient had urinary tract colonization with Staphylococcus aureus, and the urine culture showed 50,000 CFU/mL Staphylococcus aureus and 6,000 CFU/mL gram negative rods. The Important Fact states \\'Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge.\\' The Hospital Course Summary does not mention any aspiration event or blood culture results positive for GPC. The presence of GPC in blood cultures is not addressed in the summary, indicating a potential contradiction or omission.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states urine culture had 1/4 bottles positive for GPC with speciation incomplete at discharge. 2. Hospital Summary under Problem #3 reports urine culture speciated as 50,000 CFU/mL Staphylococcus aureus (GPC) and 6,000 CFU/mL gram negative rods. 3. Summary\\'s specific identification of Staph aureus contradicts the Fact\\'s claim that speciation was incomplete by discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient was finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge and started on finasteride to prevent future UTIs. The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was discharged on ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID ×7 days, which implies starting cipro on discharge, not finishing it. It also mentions that finasteride was initiated for prostatomegaly, not explicitly to prevent future UTIs, but this does not directly contradict the fact. The contradiction lies in the timing of cipro treatment relative to discharge.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states finasteride was started \\'to prevent future UTIs\\'. 2. Hospital Summary (Problem #4) documents finasteride was initiated for \\'prostatomegaly\\' with no mention of UTI prevention. 3. These represent conflicting indications for the same medication (prostate management vs UTI prevention). 4. Both statements about finasteride\\'s purpose cannot simultaneously be true.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 10, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** The patient had alcohol ketosis on presentation \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient was admitted for alcohol withdrawal and managed accordingly. There is no mention of alcohol ketosis on presentation. The summary focuses on alcohol withdrawal symptoms such as tremors, anxiety, and insomnia, and the patient was managed with phenobarbital and lorazepam. The absence of any mention of ketosis or related diagnostic findings suggests that the summary does not support the fact that the patient had alcohol ketosis on presentation.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The fact states \\'unremarkable post operative course\\' but the summary describes multiple significant complications: Pain requiring ketamine/lidocaine infusions and dilaudid PCA Hypertension with BP up to 202/114 mmHg Hyperglycemia requiring insulin management Adhesive related coccyx skin blistering requiring wound care consultation 2. These complications required specialized interventions and consultations, making the course notably remarkable rather than unremarkable.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient had an \\'unremarkable post operative course and discharge home\\' after a bilateral mastectomy for breast cancer. The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient\\'s postoperative course was \\'complicated by pain requiring ketamine/lidocaine infusions and dilaudid PCA, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and adhesive related coccyx skin blistering.\\' These complications contradict the statement of an \\'unremarkable post operative course.\\'\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'unremarkable post operative course\\'. 2. Hospital Summary documents multiple postoperative complications: pain requiring ketamine/lidocaine infusions and dilaudid PCA, hypertension (BP 202/114), hyperglycemia (glucose 245), and adhesive related skin blistering. 3. These complications contradict the characterization of the postoperative course as \\'unremarkable\\'.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows that her diabetes was worsened perioperatively, with glucose rising to 245 mg/dL postoperatively and remaining elevated at 231 mg/dL at discharge 2. This required management with insulin sliding scale during hospitalization 3. The hyperglycemia was significant enough to warrant endocrinology follow up as a pending issue 4. These findings directly contradict the statement that her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were not worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions that the patient experienced hyperglycemia postoperatively with glucose levels up to 245 mg/dL. It also states that she was managed with an insulin sliding scale and was discharged with plans to resume metformin and continue home glucose monitoring. The Important Fact states that her chronic medical conditions, including DM2, were not worsened perioperatively. The presence of hyperglycemia (glucose up to 245 mg/dL) and the need for insulin sliding scale indicate that her DM2 was affected perioperatively, contradicting the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 14, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bevacizumab was initiated during hospitalization\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Summary states \\'bevacizumab 5 mg/kg initiated\\' under Therapeutic Procedures for Problem #1. 2. Outstanding Issues list includes \\'Initiate bevacizumab therapy post elbow lesion healing\\' (item #2). 3. These two statements directly contradict cannot both be true (already initiated vs pending initiation).\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The hospital course summary discusses nausea/vomiting as a presenting symptom but attributes the primary diagnosis to AKI (acute kidney injury) in a post transplant patient. 2. The detailed problem list shows Problem #2 as \\'Nausea/Vomiting with Hypotension\\' but does not attribute it to viral gastroenteritis. 3. The summary indicates empiric antibiotics were given and then discontinued after negative cultures, but no viral etiology is mentioned. 4. The discharge diagnoses and problems focus on AKI, transplant related issues, and other organ systems, with no mention of viral gastroenteritis as the principal diagnosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary does not mention \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' as a diagnosis or a condition treated during the hospital stay. The summary focuses on acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to nausea/vomiting, and other related issues. The principal diagnosis at discharge being \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' is not supported or mentioned anywhere in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states principal diagnosis: viral gastroenteritis. 2. Hospital Summary attributes AKI to volume depletion from vomiting, treated with fluids/antiemetics. 3. Summary\\'s discharge diagnosis for Problem #1 is \\'presumed acute tubular necrosis\\' without mention of infectious etiology. 4. While empiric antibiotics were given initially, they were discontinued after negative cultures. 5. No documentation of viral testing or confirmation of gastroenteritis as cause. 6. These two diagnoses (viral gastroenteritis vs ATN from volume depletion) are mutually exclusive explanations for the AKI/vomiting.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 16, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Currently on high dose dexamethasone and Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions dexamethasone 4mg BID (twice daily), which is not a high dose 2. The summary confirms Bactrim DS TIW (three times weekly) for PJP prophylaxis 3. While Bactrim matches the fact, the dexamethasone dosing described (8mg/day) is inconsistent with \\'high dose\\' dexamethasone mentioned in the fact 4. The discrepancy in dexamethasone dosing represents a clear contradiction\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states fever resolved by hospital day 3 with empiric antibiotics 2. Initial workup showed no infectious source (negative blood cultures, normal CT abdomen/pelvis, CXR) 3. The fact states \\'persistent fever\\' and \\'suspected pulmonary infection\\', but the summary shows: Fever resolved, not persistent No pulmonary infection was found (only bibasilar atelectasis on CXR) All infectious workups were negative, consistent with the fact\\'s \\'negative infectious workups\\' 4. Since fever resolved and no pulmonary infection was confirmed, this contradicts the claim of \\'persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection\\'\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient presented with fever but had a negative initial workup for infection, which is consistent with the Important Fact of \\'Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups.\\' However, the summary further states that the patient\\'s fever resolved by hospital day 3 after empiric antibiotic treatment, and there were no signs of infection at discharge. The fact mentions \\'persistent fever,\\' but the summary indicates resolution of fever. This suggests a contradiction because \\'persistent fever\\' implies ongoing fever, whereas the summary states the fever resolved.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 18, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma recently complicated by progression to CNS lymphoma\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)\\' with CNS progression. 2. Hospital Summary documents \\'de novo transformed high grade B cell lymphoma (MYC/BCL2 rearrangements)\\' with CNS involvement. 3. High grade B cell lymphoma with MYC/BCL2 rearrangements (double hit lymphoma) is a distinct entity from DLBCL in current WHO classifications. 4. These diagnoses are mutually exclusive and represent different pathological entities, creating a direct contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 18, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states hypokalemia resolved during admission. 2. Hospital summary reports discharge potassium level at 3.3 mmol/L (still below normal range of 3.5 5.0). 3. Persistent hypokalemia at discharge contradicts resolution claim. 4. Summary explicitly states \\'hypokalemia resolved\\' despite lab evidence showing unresolved hypokalemia.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 20, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** HHT with new PE/DVT s/p IVC filter placement as well as changed to fondaparinux\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states the patient was \\'changed to fondaparinux\\' for anticoagulation. 2. Hospital Summary (Problem #1) documents \\'Transitioned from fondaparinux to apixaban 10 mg BID\\' as part of therapeutic procedures. 3. These two statements directly conflict regarding current anticoagulant therapy (fondaparinux vs apixaban).\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that the patient was discharged with a prednisone taper plan after showing improvement in thrombocytopenia. The Important Fact mentions \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\'. The summary indicates that prednisone was initiated during the hospital stay and a taper was planned for after discharge, contradicting the fact that suggests prednisone taper was initiated before the summary period.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 20, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states \\'Monitor CBC weekly\\' under Problem #2 Thrombocytopenia 2. The Important Fact states \\'twice weekly CBCs\\' 3. These frequencies conflict weekly is less frequent than twice weekly 4. Since these specific monitoring schedules cannot both be true, there is a clear contradiction\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\' was ordered. 2. Hospital summary under Problem #2 discharge plan specifies \\'Monitor CBC weekly\\'. 3. \\'Weekly\\' (summary) directly conflicts with \\'twice weekly\\' (fact) for the same test. 4. Both cannot be true simultaneously.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary identifies clear causes for the falls: NSVT episodes were found on cardiac monitoring Patient has dementia with hospital delirium Patient has documented functional decline 2. The workup was thorough and revealed findings: CT imaging showed T6 compression fracture Cardiac telemetry identified NSVT Multiple specialist evaluations (PT/OT) 3. Therefore, the falls were not of \\'unknown etiology\\' as stated in the important fact, and the workup was productive rather than remaining unclear despite extensive investigation\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup\\' 2. Hospital summary documents identification of NSVT episodes via telemetry (Problem #1) 3. NSVT was specifically addressed with metoprolol dose escalation (Hospital Course/Brief Description) 4. This constitutes identification of a potential cardiac etiology for falls through inpatient workup\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary explicitly states \\'CT spine: New T6 wedge compression fracture vs 2021 imaging\\' and \\'CT chest: Interval T6 compression deformity\\' 2. The fracture is described as \\'new\\' and \\'interval\\' in multiple places 3. This directly contradicts the Important Fact stating the fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall\\' 4. The summary presents this as an acute/subacute injury from recent falls, not a pre existing condition\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that the patient was admitted with a \\'new T6 wedge compression fracture\\' and that imaging confirmed this finding. This directly contradicts the Important Fact that the T6 wedge compression fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall\\', implying it was not new.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states T6 fracture \\'happened before most recent fall\\'. 2. Hospital summary describes \\'new T6 wedge compression fracture vs 2021 imaging\\' (Problem #1 Key Investigations). 3. \\'New\\' in medical context indicates recent occurrence, conflicting with pre existing fracture claim. 4. Admission reason specifies \\'recurrent falls resulting in subacute T6 fracture\\', temporally linking fracture to fall sequence. 5. Subacute (2 6 weeks) timing vs \\'likely happened before\\' creates irreconcilable temporal contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 23, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** large pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary states the patient had a large right pleural effusion and underwent thoracentesis (1.75L removed). 2. Post thoracentesis, the patient\\'s respiratory status improved (cough resolved, euvolemic on RA). 3. The fact \\'large pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis\\' implies ongoing effusion after the procedure, but the summary documents resolution of the effusion with treatment. 4. No mention of residual large effusion post procedure in discharge status or outstanding issues.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 23, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states Cardiology will coordinate follow up with Heart Failure team for transcatheter MVR and clinical trial drug (4/2023). 2. Hospital summary\\'s \\'Outstanding Issues\\' lists cardiology consultation and repeat TTE for mitral gradient, but no mention of Heart Failure team coordination or clinical trial planning. 3. Discharge plan for valvular disease only includes repeat TTE and possible intervention evaluation, conflicting with the specific Heart Failure team/drug trial coordination stated in the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 24, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states discharge on \\'oral pain medications\\'. 2. Hospital summary\\'s discharge medications (Problem #1) list ondansetron and metoclopramide (antiemetics), with no mention of pain medications. 3. Pain management is not addressed in discharge plans, creating contradiction with the fact\\'s assertion of oral pain meds at discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 25, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states Upper GI series showed no obstruction, which matches the summary\\'s Problem #6 (no mechanical obstruction). 2. However, Important Fact specifies IV famotidine was started first, then switched to PPI BID. The Hospital Course (Problem #6) describes \\'IV → oral PPI transition\\' without mentioning famotidine, creating a direct contradiction in medication management. 3. Both cannot be true regarding initial GI treatment (famotidine vs. IV PPI).\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia due to SMA stenosis. 2. Hospital Summary notes CT angiography identified chronic SMA stenosis but explicitly states abdominal imaging \\'ruled out acute ischemia\\' and attributes vomiting to gastroenteritis/gastroparesis. 3. No mention of chronic mesenteric ischemia as a potential contributor to emesis in discharge plans or problem summaries. 4. Attribution to gastroparesis (Problem #2) directly conflicts with the Important Fact\\'s proposed etiology.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient was admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia. The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient was admitted for neutropenic fever and blood cultures grew coagulase negative Staphylococcus (mecA+). The key discrepancy lies in the type of bacteria identified: \\'coagulase negative strep\\' versus \\'coagulase negative Staphylococcus\\'. Coagulase negative Staphylococcus and coagulase negative Streptococcus are different bacteria; the former is relevant to the patient\\'s condition as per the summary. The summary is consistent with the fact that the patient had neutropenic fever and bacteremia due to coagulase negative Staphylococcus, treated with PICC removal and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states bacteremia was caused by \\'coagulase negative strep\\' (Streptococcus species). 2. Hospital Summary (Problem #1) specifies blood cultures grew \\'coagulase negative Staphylococcus\\' (Staphylococcus species). 3. Streptococcus and Staphylococcus are distinct bacterial genera; they cannot both be correct for the same bacteremia episode. 4. This represents a direct microbiological contradiction in pathogen identification.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 28, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows PTBD exchanges on 03/25/2023 and 04/08/2023, but not on 04/21/23 as stated in the fact. 2. The hospital course details all procedures chronologically, and there is no mention of a PTBD exchange on 04/21/23. 3. The last documented PTBD intervention was upsizing to 16 Fr on 04/08/2023. 4. While the patient had recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia as stated in the fact, the specific date and procedure mentioned in the fact are not supported by the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient was admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23. The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient was admitted for persistent hyperbilirubinemia, dehydration, and hypotension in the setting of recurrent intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and underwent IR guided percutaneous biliary drain exchanges. The dates of PTBD exchanges mentioned in the summary are 03/25/2023 and 04/08/2023, but not 04/21/2023.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states PTBD exchange occurred on 4/21/23. 2. Hospital Summary lists PTBD exchanges on 03/25/2023 and 04/08/2023 (Problem #1), with no mention of 4/21/23 procedure. 3. Summary explicitly documents \\'exchanges in 2 3 months\\' as future plan, not during admission. 4. Direct date conflict between 4/21/23 (Fact) and documented 04/08/23 (Summary).\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states that bilirubin improved from 19 mg/dL to 10.8 mg/dL after PTBD exchange (\\'Bilirubin trended downward to 10.8 mg/dL\\') 2. This directly contradicts the Important Fact which states \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange\\' 3. While both summaries agree on the transition to hospice, they disagree on the response to PTBD treatment 4. The contradiction is further reinforced in Problem #1 section which documents improvement in T bili to 10.8 mg/dL at discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that \\'Bilirubin trended downward to 10.8 mg/dL\\' after PTBD exchange, indicating an improvement in bilirubin levels. This directly contradicts the Important Fact that \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange\\'. The summary further supports this improvement by stating \\'T bili improved to 10.8 mg/dL at discharge\\' under Problem #1: Malignant Biliary Obstruction.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange. 2. Hospital Summary (Problem #1) reports T bili improved from 10.8 mg/dL at discharge after PTBD exchanges. 3. These statements directly conflict regarding bilirubin response to PTBD.\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states urinary retention requiring catheter, but summary does not mention urinary retention or catheter use. 2. Important Fact specifies pharmacotherapy for delirium, but summary only lists non pharmacologic interventions (sitter, restraints). 3. Sepsis/antibiotics and fluid resuscitation are consistent with documented piperacillin tazobactam use and IV fluids.\\n\\n\\n\\n**34. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows active management of the nasopharyngeal carcinoma, including: PEG tube placement on 07/11/2023 Plans for outpatient oncology follow up for treatment planning Pending PET/CT review 2. While the patient had delirium during admission, the summary indicates: Active management of the delirium with medications and restraints Improvement to A&Ox2 at discharge 3. The summary does not indicate any deferral of cancer management due to delirium or family wishes 4. Instead, it shows a structured plan for ongoing oncology care with outpatient follow up\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was discharged with \\'Outpatient oncology follow up for treatment planning\\' and lists \\'Oncology follow up for PET/CT results and treatment planning\\' under Outstanding Issues/Follow Up. This implies that the management of the patient\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was not deferred but rather planned for outpatient follow up, contradicting the Important Fact that management was deferred to an outpatient oncologist per the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n\\n\\n**35. Patient 29, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states patient developed temporary O2 requirement due to aspiration pneumonitis and was made NPO by SLP 2. Hospital Summary Problem #2 confirms SLP recommended strict NPO for silent aspiration risk (consistent) 3. No documentation of oxygen requirement or aspiration pneumonitis diagnosis in the entire Hospital Course Summary 4. \\'Aspiration concerns\\' mentioned under complications but no clinical confirmation of pneumonitis or O2 needs 5. Contradiction exists because the Fact asserts an event (O2 requirement from pneumonitis) not documented in the Summary\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'single-prompt-gpt-4o': '# Factual evaluation of the single-prompt-gpt-4o summarizer by a LLM jury\\n\\n## Jury members: claude-3.5-sonnet-v2, llama4-maverick, deepseek-r1\\n\\n## Main results\\n\\n### A. Presence of important facts\\n\\n**Score: 48/100** (95% CI: 37-58) (higher values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the important facts missing:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries frequently omit critical clinical facts due to recurring patterns: (1) **Incomplete documentation of ongoing interventions**, where removal of devices is noted but retention is excluded (Patient 0: JP drain left at discharge), or partial treatment details are provided without key parameters (Patient 0: DVT prophylaxis mentioned, but anemia/Hb 8.8 omitted). (2) **Failure to explicitly link related conditions**, such as hypoxia attributed to pleural effusion without causal phrasing (Patient 1) or AKI in CKD not documented despite urinary retention management (Patient 4). (3) **Procedural/timeline vagueness**, omitting surgical steps (Patient 2: adhesion takedown), medication specifics (Patient 6: insulin type/dose discrepancies), or temporal patterns (Patient 5: POD1 drain output trends). (4) **Diagnostic ambiguity**, where findings are implied but not stated (Patient 8: MRSA nares vs. sputum source) or critical terminology is avoided (Patient 17: \"delirium tremens\" vs. \"alcohol withdrawal\"). (5) **Discharge plan omissions**, including follow-up frequency (Patient 12: TPN without 4-week timeline) or diet/medication specifics (Patient 24: full liquid diet assumed but not explicitly stated). These patterns highlight systemic gaps in specificity, causal attribution, and comprehensive documentation across diverse clinical scenarios.\\n\\n### B. Hospital course summaries contradicting important facts\\n\\n**Score: 12/100** (95% CI: 5-18) (lower values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the inconsistencies:**\\n\\nHospital course inconsistencies commonly arise from **direct therapeutic or diagnostic contradictions**, **omission of critical details**, and **temporal or interpretive mismatches**. For example, Patient 0’surgical drain status conflicts between \"removed\" (summary) and \"left at discharge\" (fact), while Patient 6’s insulin regimen discrepancies (Levemir 16 BID vs. Lantus 15 BID) reflect medication/dose errors. Diagnostic contradictions include Patient 12’s gallbladder fistula (summary: \"no definitive fistula\" vs. fact: \"found\"), Patient 15’s principal diagnosis (summary omits viral gastroenteritis), and Patient 21’s fracture timing (summary: \"new\" vs. fact: \"pre-existing\"). **Omissions** are evident in Patient 9’s missing cipro/finasteride documentation and Patient 29’s unmentioned deferral of cancer management. **Interpretive mismatches** occur in Patient 26 (SMA stenosis attributed to gastroparesis vs. mesenteric ischemia) and Patient 18’s hypokalemia (fact: \"resolved\" vs. summary: ongoing supplementation). Temporal inconsistencies also appear in Patient 18’s \"persistent fever\" (fact) versus \"afebrile at discharge\" (summary). These patterns highlight errors in documentation specificity, reconciliation of imaging/clinical findings, and medication/diagnosis attribution.\\n\\n## Detailed results\\n\\n### A.

All Missing Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 0, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left-sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of a left sided abdominal JP drain being present at discharge. While the summary does mention drains in general (\\'close attention to fluids and drains\\' and \\'amylase levels normalized leading to drain removal\\'), it actually suggests that drains were removed prior to discharge rather than being left in place. The statement about \\'drain removal\\' specifically indicates that at least some drains were taken out. There is no mention of any drain being retained at discharge, and specifically no mention of a left sided abdominal JP drain being present at discharge.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact \\'Left sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\' is explicitly mentioned, I analyzed the provided hospital course summary. The summary details the patient\\'s hospital course, including the Whipple procedure for duodenal adenocarcinoma, postoperative care, and discharge plans. Under \\'Problem #1: Duodenal Adenocarcinoma Post Whipple Procedure,\\' it is mentioned that \\'amylase levels normalized leading to drain removal.\\' This indicates that drains were removed before discharge. The summary does not explicitly or implicitly mention a left sided abdominal JP drain being left at the time of discharge. Therefore, the fact is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'drain removal\\' due to normalized amylase levels in Problem #1\\'s Current Clinical Status, indicating drains were removed prior to discharge. While drains are referenced in the context of postoperative care, there is no specific mention of a \\'left sided abdominal JP drain\\' being left in place at discharge. The text explicitly states drain removal occurred, which contradicts the presence of a remaining drain at discharge. No equivalent terms or abbreviations for this specific drain type and location are found in the document.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 0, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Discharged with DVT prophylaxis, with anemia at hemoglobin 8.8\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary looking for explicit mention of discharge hemoglobin level of 8.8 and DVT prophylaxis. While the summary does mention Lovenox (a DVT prophylaxis medication) in two places under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' and under Problem #1\\'s discharge plan (\\'ensure compliance with Lovenox\\'), there is no mention anywhere of the patient\\'s hemoglobin level being 8.8 or any indication of anemia. The fact requires both components (DVT prophylaxis AND hemoglobin of 8.8) to be considered fully present. While one component (DVT prophylaxis) is clearly documented, the other (specific hemoglobin value and anemia) is not mentioned at all. Therefore, the complete fact as stated is not fully present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact \\'Discharged with DVT prophylaxis, with anemia at hemoglobin 8.8\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary, we need to analyze the provided text for relevant information. The summary includes sections on the hospital course, outstanding issues, and problem based summaries. We look for mentions of \\'DVT prophylaxis\\' and \\'anemia\\' or \\'hemoglobin 8.8\\'. The summary mentions \\'Lovenox Teaching and Monitoring\\' under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\', indicating DVT prophylaxis since Lovenox is commonly used for this purpose. However, there is no explicit mention of \\'anemia\\' or a \\'hemoglobin level of 8.8\\' in the provided summary. Thus, while DVT prophylaxis is implied through Lovenox administration, the specific detail about anemia and hemoglobin level is not present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Checking for DVT prophylaxis: The summary states under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' that there is \\'Lovenox Teaching and Monitoring.\\' Lovenox (enoxaparin) is a standard DVT prophylaxis medication, so this part of the fact is explicitly mentioned. 2. Checking for anemia with hemoglobin 8.8: The summary does not contain any mention of anemia, hemoglobin levels, or a hemoglobin value of 8.8 in any section (including problem summaries, discharge plans, or medical history). While nutritional issues are discussed, anemia is not referenced. 3. Conclusion: While DVT prophylaxis is clearly documented, the anemia component is entirely absent. Since both elements are required for the fact to be considered mentioned, the overall fact is not fully present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 1, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypoxia 2/2 recurrent R pleura effusion\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact \\'Hypoxia 2/2 recurrent R pleura effusion\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary, we need to analyze the provided text. The summary is structured into several sections including a one liner, brief description of hospital course, outstanding issues/follow up, and a problem based summary. The fact in question involves two main components: hypoxia and its relation to a recurrent right pleural effusion. We will look for explicit mentions or clear implications of these components. Under \\'Problem #2: Hypoxia and Respiratory Management,\\' it is stated that the patient had \\'persistent hypoxia\\' and that there was a \\'potential future dependency on home supplemental oxygen due to baseline pulmonary status.\\' Additionally, under \\'Problem #1: Right Loculated Pleural Effusion,\\' it is mentioned that there is a need to \\'Monitor for recurrent effusion.\\' While the summary does not directly state \\'Hypoxia 2/2 recurrent R pleura effusion,\\' it implies a connection between hypoxia and the pleural effusion through the context provided. However, the direct causal link \\'2/2\\' (secondary to) between hypoxia and recurrent right pleural effusion is not explicitly stated in the summary. The closest relevant information is found under the respective problem sections which discuss hypoxia and pleural effusion separately but indicate ongoing issues with both. Thus, while the summary strongly suggests a relationship between the patient\\'s hypoxia and pleural effusion, it does not explicitly state that the hypoxia is secondary to the recurrent right pleural effusion.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The fact in question is \\'Hypoxia 2/2 recurrent R pleura effusion\\' (hypoxia secondary to recurrent right pleural effusion). 2. The hospital course explicitly documents hypoxia in Problem #2 (Hypoxia and Respiratory Management), including persistent hypoxia and post procedural desaturation. 3. The summary also documents recurrent right pleural effusion in Problem #1 (Right Loculated Pleural Effusion), with monitoring for recurrence listed as an outstanding issue. 4. However, the text does not explicitly state a causal relationship between hypoxia and recurrent pleural effusion. While both conditions are present, the effusion\\'s loculated nature and partial resolution are described, and hypoxia is attributed to \\'baseline pulmonary status\\' rather than directly to recurrent effusion. 5. Though a temporal association exists (hypoxia persisted post chest tube removal), the summary does not use phrasing that clearly attributes hypoxia etiology to recurrent effusion. No clinical synonyms or abbreviations (e.g., \\'hypoxia due to recurrent R effusion\\') are present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 2, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed. Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** While the summary mentions that a laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed (under Problem #1), it does not explicitly mention the specific surgical details about taking down adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall or removing obstructing necrotic mass. The summary only states that there was \\'a necrotic mass in the small bowel\\' and that a \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' was performed on 04/24/2023. While the presence of the necrotic mass is mentioned, the specific surgical steps of taking down adhesions and removing the obstructing mass are not explicitly detailed in the hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'Laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis performed\\' under Therapeutic Procedures for Problem #1, which directly matches the second part of the target fact. The summary also states a \\'necrotic mass in the small bowel\\' was identified and resected, fulfilling the \\'obstructing necrotic mass were removed\\' component. However, there is no mention of adhesions between the omentum and abdominal wall being taken down in any section of the summary. While the resection and mass removal are clearly documented, the adhesion takedown is absent. Since the fact requires both components (adhesion takedown + mass removal/resection), and one component is missing, the full fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 2, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient recovered from surgery well; had flatus and bowel movement \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After analyzing the hospital course summary, while it mentions that the patient underwent a successful laparoscopic small bowel resection and had \\'improved tolerance of oral intake,\\' it does not explicitly mention the passage of flatus or bowel movement postoperatively. The summary states that the \\'postoperative course was unremarkable\\' and that the patient was \\'stable post surgery with no acute concerns,\\' but these general statements don\\'t specifically confirm the return of bowel function. Since the return of bowel function (flatus and bowel movement) is a critical post operative milestone, and it is not explicitly mentioned in any form in the summary, we must conclude that this specific fact is not present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if it mentions that the patient recovered from surgery well, had flatus, and had a bowel movement. The summary states that the patient underwent a \\'successful laparoscopic small bowel resection\\' and postoperatively, her course was \\'unremarkable.\\' It also mentions that there was \\'improved tolerance of oral intake,\\' indicating a return to normal bowel function. However, the specific details about flatus and bowel movement are not explicitly mentioned. Despite this, the overall context suggests a smooth recovery, which aligns with the fact in question.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states that the patient had an \\'unremarkable\\' postoperative course with \\'improved tolerance of oral intake\\' but does not explicitly mention flatus or bowel movement. While these are common markers of postoperative gastrointestinal recovery, the text does not use these terms or clear synonyms (e.g., \\'passing gas,\\' \\'BM,\\' \\'bowel function return\\'). The absence of these specific indicators—despite describing other aspects of recovery—means the fact is not explicitly documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 3, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** R-sided chest pain 2/2 port-associated thrombus\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'chest pain\\' and \\'right port thrombus\\' in the one liner and Problem #3 (Port associated Thrombus). However, the chest pain is consistently attributed to metastatic disease in Problem #2 (Cancer related Pain) and the Brief Description, where it states \\'chest pain [...] due to progressive metastatic disease.\\' The port associated thrombus is described as a separate issue managed with anticoagulation, with no documented causal link to the chest pain. Since the fact requires chest pain to be explicitly linked to the port thrombus (2/2), and this connection is absent in the text, the fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 4, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze step by step: 1. The text mentions AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) on CKD: Not explicitly mentioned. While CKD IV is clearly documented, there is no mention of acute kidney injury. 2. Urinary retention: Explicitly mentioned multiple times, including in the one liner and Problem #2 section. 3. Treatment with foley catheter: Explicitly mentioned in Problem #2 section \"Foley placed for retention due to enlarged prostate\" and \"Foley catheter management.\" 4. Causation (2/2): While the urinary retention and foley placement are mentioned, there is no explicit statement linking AKI to the urinary retention. The text only discusses stable CKD IV without mention of acute injury. While parts of the fact are present (urinary retention and foley placement), the critical component of AKI on CKD is not mentioned. The summary only discusses stable CKD IV with Cr 3.64 3.80 mg/dL, without indicating an acute injury. Therefore, the complete fact as stated is not fully present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient had urinary retention, for which a Foley catheter was placed. It also mentions the patient\\'s history of CKD IV and that their kidney function was monitored during the hospital stay. The summary under \\'Problem #2: CKD IV and Urinary Retention\\' states that the patient had CKD IV and urinary retention, and that a Foley catheter was placed due to an enlarged prostate, indicating urinary retention was treated with Foley catheter placement. Although the summary does not explicitly state \\'AKI on CKD\\', it does mention that the patient\\'s creatinine levels were monitored and were in the range of 3.64 3.80 mg/dL, indicating some level of kidney dysfunction. However, it does not directly state that there was an acute kidney injury (AKI) on top of CKD. Nonetheless, the key elements of CKD, urinary retention, and treatment with a Foley catheter are all present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions CKD IV and urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement. However, it does not explicitly state \\'AKI on CKD\\' (acute kidney injury superimposed on chronic kidney disease). While the summary documents CKD IV and urinary retention as a problem, and notes foley placement for retention, there is no mention of an acute kidney injury episode (e.g., rising creatinine from baseline, documentation of AKI terminology, or acute worsening of renal function). The creatinine level (3.64 3.80 mg/dL) is presented as part of the chronic CKD IV status rather than an acute change. Thus, while CKD and urinary retention management are documented, the specific fact of \\'AKI on CKD\\' is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 5, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Increased bloody output from JP drain observed on POD1, gradually improved\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of increased bloody output from the JP drain on POD1 that gradually improved. While the summary does discuss JP drain output in several places (including mentions in the Brief Description, Outstanding Issues, and Problem Based Summary sections), it does not specifically state that there was increased bloody output on POD1 or describe a gradual improvement pattern. The only specific detail about the drain output is in the Problem Based Summary section, which notes a \\'reduction in JP drain output\\' on POD3, but this does not indicate whether there was increased bloody output on POD1. The summary mentions \\'some complications with JP drain output\\' but does not specify the nature or timing of these complications.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient \\'experienced some complications with JP drain output\\' post operatively, and there are instructions to \\'monitor JP drain output\\' and \\'recognizing abnormal output volumes or characteristics\\' upon discharge. On POD3, there was a \\'reduction in JP drain output.\\' While the summary does not explicitly state \\'increased bloody output from JP drain observed on POD1,\\' it implies that there was an issue with JP drain output that later reduced. However, the specific detail about \\'increased bloody output on POD1\\' is not directly mentioned. The closest information is the mention of complications with JP drain output and its later reduction.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'complications with JP drain output\\' post operatively and specifically notes \\'a reduction in JP drain output\\' by post operative day three (POD3). However, it does not explicitly state that increased bloody output was observed on POD1 or describe a gradual improvement starting from POD1. While the reduction by POD3 implies improvement over time, the specific timing (POD1) and characterization of the output as \\'bloody\\' are not mentioned. The summary lacks direct references to POD1 drain characteristics or a clear timeline of output changes starting from that day.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step: 1. The one liner confirms the patient has Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2 and primary adrenal insufficiency 2. The summary explicitly states the patient was admitted for adrenal crisis presenting with hypotension 3. However, while the text mentions the adrenal crisis and its treatment with IV hydrocortisone, it does not explicitly state that the crisis was due to PO prednisone intolerance 4. The summary mentions transitioning from IV to oral hydrocortisone (not prednisone), but doesn\\'t discuss any previous medication intolerance 5. While malabsorption workup is mentioned as pending, there\\'s no explicit connection made between medication intolerance and the adrenal crisis 6. Therefore, while the adrenal crisis in a patient with APS and primary adrenal insufficiency is clearly documented, the specific detail about it being due to PO prednisone intolerance is not explicitly mentioned\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient was admitted with an adrenal crisis, and it is implied that this occurred in the context of primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2. The summary does not directly state that the adrenal crisis was due to intolerance of PO prednisone. However, it does mention the patient\\'s condition and treatment, including the transition from IV hydrocortisone to oral hydrocortisone, indicating a management plan for adrenal insufficiency. The fact that the patient was on IV hydrocortisone and was being transitioned to oral hydrocortisone suggests that there was an issue with their adrenal crisis management, potentially related to their oral medication regimen. While \\'prednisone\\' is not mentioned, \\'hydrocortisone\\' is a steroid used for adrenal insufficiency, and issues with oral administration could imply intolerance or inadequate dosing. Thus, the summary implies a potential issue with the patient\\'s oral steroid regimen, aligning with the notion of intolerance to PO prednisone or another oral steroid.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions adrenal crisis in the context of primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2 (stated in the one liner and Problem #1). However, there is no mention of prednisone use, intolerance to oral prednisone, or any reference to prednisone in the therapeutic regimen. The treatment described uses hydrocortisone (IV and oral), not prednisone. While the first three components of the fact (adrenal crisis, primary adrenal insufficiency, autoimmune polyglandular syndrome) are clearly present, the attribution to \\'intolerance of PO prednisone\\' is absent. The summary does not discuss prednisone at all, nor does it suggest a medication related cause for the crisis.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Analyzing the summary step by step: 1. Type 1 diabetes is explicitly mentioned multiple times in the summary, including in the one liner and Problem #2. 2. Regarding insulin changes: The summary mentions the patient was converted from insulin gtt (drip) to subcutaneous insulin The discharge plan specifically states \\'Use Levemir 16 UNITS BID\\' (not Lantus 15 units) 3. While insulin changes are mentioned, the specific change to Lantus 15 units twice daily is not mentioned anywhere in the text. Instead, a different insulin (Levemir) at a different dose (16 units) is prescribed. 4. The fact we\\'re looking for requires both Type 1 diabetes AND a specific insulin change to Lantus 15 units twice daily. While the diabetes part is present, the specific insulin change mentioned is different.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and that she was converted from insulin gtt (intravenous insulin) to a subcutaneous insulin regimen. The discharge plan for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus states that the patient will be using \\'Levemir 16 UNITS BID and Insulin 1:7 TID AC\\'. Although the summary does not explicitly mention \\'Lantus\\', Levemir is another long acting insulin, similar to Lantus. However, the exact medication mentioned is Levemir, not Lantus. The dosage is also different (16 units BID vs 15 units twice a day). Therefore, the specific fact \\'insulin changed to Lantus 15units twice a day\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary under Problem #2: Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus states the discharge plan includes \\'Levemir 16 UNITS BID and Insulin 1:7 TID AC.\\' Levemir (insulin detemir) is a different basal insulin from Lantus (insulin glargine), and the specified dose is 16 units BID rather than 15 units BID. While the summary confirms a change in insulin regimen, it does not explicitly mention Lantus or the 15 unit dose. The phrasing \\'converted subcutaneous from insulin gtt\\' also lacks specificity about the exact regimen change. No synonyms, abbreviations, or equivalent phrasing matching \\'Lantus 15units twice a day\\' are present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 7, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left renal cell carcinoma status-post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post-op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The hospital course summary mentions the key elements of left renal cell carcinoma and IVC thrombectomy, but does not explicitly mention neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Breaking down the analysis: 1. Left renal cell carcinoma is confirmed in multiple places: One liner mentions \\'renal mass identified as renal cell carcinoma\\' Problem #1 specifically lists \\'Renal Cell Carcinoma with IVC Tumor Thrombus\\' 2. Left nephrectomy is confirmed: \\'Left radical nephrectomy\\' is mentioned multiple times 3. IVC thrombectomy is confirmed: \\'IVC tumor thrombectomy\\' is explicitly mentioned in the brief description 4. However, there is no mention of neoadjuvant chemotherapy anywhere in the summary: The surgical history section doesn\\'t mention it The problem based summary doesn\\'t reference any pre surgical chemotherapy No chemotherapy history is noted in the relevant medical history Since neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a key component of the fact we\\'re looking for and it\\'s not mentioned, we must mark this as 0.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides a detailed account of the patient\\'s admission and treatment for renal cell carcinoma with IVC tumor thrombus. The \\'One Liner\\' section introduces the patient with a renal mass identified as renal cell carcinoma with IVC tumor thrombus. The \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' section mentions that the patient underwent a left radical nephrectomy and IVC tumor thrombectomy. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' under \\'Problem #1: Renal Cell Carcinoma with IVC Tumor Thrombus\\' further elaborates on the diagnosis, treatment, and current status of the renal cell carcinoma. It confirms the diagnosis through imaging, the therapeutic procedures performed (left radical nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy), and the patient\\'s stable postoperative recovery. Although the summary does not explicitly mention \\'neoadjuvant chemotherapy,\\' it comprehensively covers the diagnosis, surgical treatment, and postoperative status of the left renal cell carcinoma and IVC thrombectomy.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly states \\'left radical nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy\\' under Therapeutic Procedures Performed (Problem #1), confirming the surgical components of the fact. 2. The diagnosis of \\'renal cell carcinoma with IVC tumor thrombus\\' is clearly documented in the One Liner and Problem #1. 3. However, there is no mention of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in any section of the hospital course summary, including diagnostic investigations, therapeutic procedures, or medical history. 4. While the surgical components and diagnosis are present, the absence of any reference to preoperative chemotherapy (neoadjuvant therapy) means the full fact as stated is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 7, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second-line\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of: 1) Any treatment with ipi/nivo (ipilimumab/nivolumab), 2) A hypersensitivity reaction to these medications, or 3) A switch to cabozantinib as second line therapy. The summary only mentions the patient\\'s renal cell carcinoma diagnosis and surgical management via nephrectomy. While there is mention of follow up with oncology (Dr. Mark Nickelson), there are no details about systemic therapy choices or changes. The only treatments discussed are related to the surgery and post operative care.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary is analyzed to determine if it mentions a hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo and a switch to cabozantinib as a second line treatment. Upon reviewing the summary, there is no mention of \\'ipi/nivo\\' (likely referring to ipilimumab/nivolumab, a combination immunotherapy) or \\'cabozantinib\\' (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in renal cell carcinoma treatment). The summary focuses on the patient\\'s surgical resection for renal cell carcinoma and postoperative care, without discussing prior systemic treatments or changes in treatment regimens. Therefore, the specific fact regarding a hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo and switching to cabozantinib is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed the entire hospital course summary for mentions of immunotherapy (ipi/nivo) or cabozantinib. 2. Scanned \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' and \\'Discharge Plan\\' sections across all problem summaries only surgical interventions and apixaban/CPAP/diabetes management are documented. 3. Checked \\'Relevant Medical History\\' and \\'Outstanding Issues\\' no references to prior immunotherapy use or adverse reactions. 4. Oncology follow up is mentioned but without specifying treatment agents. 5. No documentation of hypersensitivity reactions, treatment changes due to adverse events, or second line therapies like cabozantinib in any section. The summary focuses on surgical recovery and chronic condition management without addressing systemic cancer treatments.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 8, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Down\\'s syndrome, neurogenic bladder, admitted for pneumonia, treated with CAP regimen and vancomycin due to positive sputum culture for MRSA\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze each component of the fact: 1. Down\\'s syndrome: Explicitly mentioned in both the one liner and relevant medical history 2. Neurogenic bladder: Explicitly mentioned in the one liner and detailed in Problem #2 3. Admitted for pneumonia: Clearly stated in the one liner and Brief Description as \\'admitted for community acquired pneumonia\\' 4. Treatment with CAP regimen and vancomycin: The summary states that the patient received \\'IV antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin\\' 5. Positive sputum culture for MRSA: While the summary mentions \\'sputum culture with rare staph aureus\\' and \\'MRSA nares positivity\\', it doesn\\'t explicitly state that the sputum culture was positive for MRSA specifically. The vancomycin addition was due to MRSA nares positivity, not a positive sputum culture for MRSA. All components are present except for the specific mention of MRSA in the sputum culture, which is a key part of the fact we\\'re looking for. Therefore, while most elements are present, we cannot say the entire fact as stated is explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Down\\'s syndrome and neurogenic bladder are explicitly listed in the \\'One Liner\\' and \\'Relevant Medical History\\' sections. 2. Admission for pneumonia is clearly stated in the \\'One Liner\\' and Problem #1 (Community Acquired Pneumonia). 3. CAP regimen is addressed with ceftriaxone + azithromycin (standard CAP coverage), and vancomycin is documented as part of the therapy. 4. However, vancomycin was added due to \\'MRSA nares positivity\\' (nasal swab), not a positive sputum culture for MRSA. The sputum culture only showed \\'rare staph aureus\\' without MRSA specification. 5. The critical distinction: The fact requires vancomycin use to be linked to MRSA in sputum, but the summary explicitly ties it to nasal MRSA colonization. No sputum MRSA result is documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find any explicit mention of: 1) an aspiration event prior to discharge, 2) blood cultures showing 1/4 bottles positive for GPC (Gram positive cocci), or 3) pending speciation results. The summary discusses the patient\\'s pneumonia treatment course, including antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin, and mentions a sputum culture with rare staph aureus. However, there is no mention of blood cultures, their results, or any aspiration events. The only cultures explicitly mentioned are sputum and urine cultures. While the patient has a history of dysphagia and G tube placement, which puts them at risk for aspiration, no actual aspiration event is documented in this summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task requires determining whether the fact \\'Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. To accomplish this, I analyzed the summary section by section. The \\'One Liner\\' section provides a brief overview of the patient\\'s condition and history but does not mention the specific fact. The \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' discusses the patient\\'s admission for community acquired pneumonia and improvement during hospitalization but does not reference any aspiration event or GPC positivity. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists several follow up tasks but does not include the specific fact. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' section details the patient\\'s issues, including community acquired pneumonia, neurogenic bladder and bowel, and nutrition/dysphagia. While it discusses sputum culture results showing rare Staph aureus, it does not mention GPC or an aspiration event. The \\'Relevant Medical History\\' and \\'Relevant Surgical History\\' sections provide background information but also do not contain the fact in question. Since there is no explicit mention of a potential aspiration event, GPC positivity, or speciation status in the summary, the fact is not present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) The fact specifies three elements: potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, and incomplete speciation at discharge. 2) The summary documents dysphagia and tube feeding (a chronic risk factor for aspiration) but does not describe any acute aspiration event near discharge. 3) Sputum culture identified rare Staph aureus (a GPC), but there is no mention of \\'1/4 bottles\\' or multiple culture bottles. 4) Speciation for Staph aureus was completed (identified by name), contradicting the \\'speciation not complete\\' element. While GPCs are present via Staph aureus identification, the specific phrasing and context of the fact (multiple culture bottles, incomplete speciation) are absent. The summary does not explicitly state the three components together as described in the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step: 1. The summary confirms sepsis/complicated UTI from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis (explicitly stated in Problem #1 and one liner) 2. However, there is no mention of: A 7 day course of cipro specifically (text mentions Zosyn instead) Starting finasteride Any preventive medications for future UTIs 3. While the text does mention treatment with antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn), it\\'s different from the specific treatment mentioned in the fact 4. The discharge plan mentions continuing Zosyn, not cipro 5. Though there is a history of recurrent UTIs noted, there\\'s no mention of preventive measures being initiated Therefore, while some elements overlap (urinary source infection/pyelonephritis), the specific treatment details and preventive measures mentioned in the fact are not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details a patient admitted for a complicated UTI potentially escalating into pyelonephritis. The patient was treated with antibiotics and showed improvement. However, upon reviewing the summary, there is no explicit mention of \\'sepsis from urinary source.\\' Although the patient presented with fever, confusion, and weakness, and was diagnosed with a complicated UTI potentially escalating into pyelonephritis caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, the term \\'sepsis\\' is not used. Additionally, the summary does not mention the patient finishing a \\'7 day course of cipro on discharge\\'; instead, it states the patient was discharged on Zosyn with pending sensitivities. Lastly, there is no mention of starting finasteride to prevent future UTIs. Therefore, the specific fact provided is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis mention: The summary states \\'complicated UTI potentially escalating into pyelonephritis\\' and mentions \\'sepsis resolution\\' in follow up plans, but does not explicitly use the term \\'sepsis\\' in the context of the admission diagnosis. 2. Urinary source with pyelonephritis: Explicitly stated in Problem #1 (\\'complicated UTI with potential pyelonephritis\\'). 3. 7 day cipro course: The discharge plan specifies continuing Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam), not cipro. No mention of ciprofloxacin use. 4. Finasteride initiation: No reference to finasteride in any section of the summary. While pyelonephritis and UTI source are confirmed, two critical components (cipro completion and finasteride initiation) are absent from the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 9, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling, DVT US negative, unclear etiology \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no mention of right upper extremity or left lower extremity swelling, nor any DVT ultrasound studies. The summary covers the patient\\'s primary problems (complicated UTI, diabetes, and possible NPH) in detail, along with their diagnostic workup and management. While the summary includes various diagnostic tests and clinical findings, it does not mention any extremity swelling or DVT related investigations. The physical examination findings and diagnostic studies described focus on the UTI, diabetes management, and neurological symptoms. There is no explicit or implicit reference to extremity swelling or DVT ultrasound results.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was thoroughly reviewed to determine if the fact \\'Right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling, DVT US negative, unclear etiology\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary covers the patient\\'s admission for a complicated UTI, management of diabetes, and evaluation of possible normal pressure hydrocephalus. It details the patient\\'s diagnosis, treatment, and follow up plans for various conditions. However, upon careful examination, there is no mention of swelling in the right upper extremity or left lower extremity, nor is there any reference to a DVT ultrasound or its results. The summary focuses on the patient\\'s UTI, diabetic management, and potential neurological issues without addressing extremity swelling or DVT evaluations.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed section by section. The \\'One Liner\\' and \\'Brief Description\\' focus on UTI management and possible hydrocephalus. The \\'Outstanding Issues\\' and problem based summaries (Problems #1 3) detail UTI treatment, diabetes management, and hydrocephalus evaluation. There is no mention of extremity swelling (right upper or left lower), DVT ultrasound results, or any discussion of unexplained edema in any part of the document. The surgical history mentions orchiectomy but no vascular studies. All documented assessments and follow ups relate to infections, diabetes, and neurological evaluation without reference to limb swelling or negative DVT imaging.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 10, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** The patient with polysubstance use disorder (alcohol, meth) was admitted to the hospital due to concerns for acute alcohol withdrawal and received inpatient treatment for alcohol use disorder as well as linkages to outpatient MAT treatment. \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact that \\'the patient with polysubstance use disorder (alcohol, meth) was admitted to the hospital due to concerns for acute alcohol withdrawal and received inpatient treatment for alcohol use disorder as well as linkages to outpatient MAT treatment\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. The summary indicates the patient was admitted for alcohol withdrawal and received treatment for it. It mentions \\'polysubstance abuse disorder\\' and positive urine toxicology for ethanol and methamphetamine, confirming polysubstance use. The summary also details inpatient treatment for alcohol withdrawal and follow up with addiction medicine, which implies treatment for alcohol use disorder. However, it does not explicitly mention \\'linkages to outpatient MAT treatment\\'. It does mention \\'outpatient follow up with addiction medicine\\' and \\'consideration for residential treatment\\', which are related to ongoing addiction treatment. Despite this, \\'MAT treatment\\' specifically is not mentioned. Therefore, the fact is partially mentioned but not entirely, as it lacks the specific detail about \\'MAT treatment\\'.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly states the patient was admitted for alcohol withdrawal and has polysubstance abuse disorder (alcohol and meth) in the one liner and Problem #1. 2. Inpatient treatment for alcohol use disorder is evidenced by pharmacological management (lorazepam, thiamine), addiction consults, and discharge planning with naloxone/outpatient addiction follow up. 3. However, MAT (medication assisted treatment) linkages are not explicitly mentioned while addiction follow up is planned, there is no specific reference to MAT medications (e.g., naltrexone, acamprosate) or structured MAT programs. 4. The combination of \\'inpatient treatment for alcohol use disorder\\' is clearly present, but MAT linkages (a distinct element in the target fact) are only implied through general addiction follow up rather than explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 10, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** The patient had alcohol ketosis on presentation \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of alcohol ketosis on presentation. The summary details the patient\\'s admission for alcohol withdrawal and mentions several complications including liver injury, cirrhosis, and pancytopenia, but does not specifically mention ketosis. While the patient\\'s alcohol use and its complications are extensively documented, including elevated LFTs and positive urine toxicology for ethanol, there is no reference to ketosis or a metabolic derangement consistent with alcohol ketosis. The admission details focus on withdrawal symptoms and liver related issues rather than ketotic state.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'alcohol ketosis\\' on presentation. The summary discusses the patient\\'s admission for alcohol withdrawal, positive urine toxicology for ethanol, and various liver issues potentially related to alcohol use, such as elevated LFTs and cirrhotic morphology on ultrasound. However, \\'alcohol ketosis\\' or \\'alcoholic ketoacidosis,\\' which is the likely condition being referred to, is not directly mentioned in the provided text. The closest related information is the discussion of the patient\\'s alcohol dependence and withdrawal, but this does not directly equate to alcohol ketosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'alcohol ketosis\\' or any direct synonyms (e.g., alcoholic ketoacidosis, ketonemia, ketonuria). While the patient has a history of alcohol dependence and was admitted for withdrawal, the documented findings (elevated LFTs, positive ethanol on toxicology, cirrhotic morphology) focus on liver injury and withdrawal management. No ketosis related labs (e.g., anion gap, serum/urine ketones) or treatments (e.g., dextrose for hypoglycemia) are noted. The absence of any reference to ketosis or its clinical indicators suggests this fact is not mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 12, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was started on empiric antibiotics but was found to have a normal WBC with normal lactate and abx were discontinued, he was not discharged on antibiotics\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of: 1) The patient being started on empiric antibiotics, 2) Having a normal WBC count, 3) Having a normal lactate level, or 4) Antibiotics being discontinued. While the summary discusses various aspects of the patient\\'s care including TPN management, gallbladder fistula concerns, and electrolyte management, it does not contain any information about antibiotic administration or discontinuation. The laboratory values mentioned are primarily focused on BUN, glucose, and triglycerides, but do not include WBC or lactate values. Additionally, the discharge medications or plans do not mention anything about antibiotics or their discontinuation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention that the patient was started on empiric antibiotics, had a normal WBC with normal lactate, and that antibiotics were discontinued. It also doesn\\'t state that the patient was not discharged on antibiotics. The summary focuses on the patient\\'s management with non surgical interventions, including TPN and close monitoring, and discusses the patient\\'s condition and discharge planning related to the gallbladder enteric fistula and other issues. There is no direct mention of antibiotic use or its discontinuation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not mention antibiotics at any point. Key components of the fact (empiric antibiotics initiation, normal WBC/lactate results, antibiotic discontinuation, or discharge without antibiotics) are absent. While infection related issues like gallbladder fistula and monitoring for infection signs are noted, there is no explicit reference to antibiotic use, lab values related to infection (WBC/lactate), or decisions to stop/discontinue antibiotics. The summary focuses on TPN, imaging, and non surgical management instead.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 12, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was discharged on TPN with instructions to follow up in 4 weeks  \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After analyzing the hospital course summary, I found that while the discharge on TPN is explicitly mentioned multiple times (e.g., \\'Discharge with home TPN\\' and \\'Home TPN arranged, with Soleo Health providing infusion supplies and support\\'), there is no explicit mention of a 4 week follow up instruction. The summary does mention follow up requirements with Primary Care and IR consultation, but does not specify a 4 week timeframe. The discharge planning sections mention various follow ups needed but none with the specific 4 week timing mentioned in the fact we\\'re looking for.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, management, and discharge plans. To determine if the fact \\'He was discharged on TPN with instructions to follow up in 4 weeks\\' is mentioned, we need to look for evidence of discharge on TPN and a follow up instruction in 4 weeks. The summary indicates that the patient was managed with TPN during the stay and that \\'Discharge with home TPN\\' was part of the plan. It also mentions \\'Follow up with Primary Care for monitoring labs and treatment regimen adherence.\\' However, it does not specify a follow up in exactly 4 weeks. Despite this, the presence of TPN at discharge is confirmed.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions discharge with TPN in multiple sections (e.g., \\'Discharge with home TPN\\' in Problem #1 and \\'Home TPN arranged\\' in Problem #3). However, the specific instruction to \\'follow up in 4 weeks\\' is not found anywhere in the text. While follow up with Primary Care and home health is mentioned, no time frame of 4 weeks is specified. The absence of this temporal detail means the full fact as stated is not explicitly documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly states the patient was admitted for \\'bilateral complete mastectomies and right axillary lymph node dissection,\\' matching the bilateral mastectomy component of the fact. 2. The postoperative course is described as \\'largely uneventful\\' with \\'no signs of infection or major complications,\\' which is a direct clinical equivalent to \\'unremarkable postoperative course.\\' 3. While the summary details discharge plans (e.g., wound care, follow ups) and mentions transitioning to oral medications, the phrase \\'discharge home\\' is not explicitly stated anywhere in the text. The absence of this specific terminology (or a clear synonym like \\'discharged to home\\') means this component of the fact is missing. 4. Despite strong evidence for the first two components, the lack of explicit documentation about discharge disposition (even if implied by context) requires a 0 for the full fact as defined.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, particularly the section on comorbid conditions (Problem #3), there is no explicit statement indicating that the patient\\'s chronic medical conditions, including DM2, were stable or not worsened perioperatively. In fact, the summary notes that blood glucose was elevated and required management with insulin sliding scale. The summary mentions \\'hyperglycemia being managed\\' which could suggest some degree of perioperative glucose control challenges. Without an explicit statement about the stability or lack of worsening of her chronic conditions, and with evidence of at least some glucose management needs, we cannot definitively say this fact is present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly lists Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM2) under \\'Relevant Medical History\\' and \\'Problem #3: Comorbid Conditions\\'. 2. Under \\'Problem #3\\', it states \\'hyperglycemia being managed\\' and discharge instructions include \\'Continue moderate sliding scale insulin regimen\\'. 3. While the text documents management of DM2, there is no explicit statement about whether DM2 was or was not worsened perioperatively. The summary mentions elevated blood glucose but does not characterize this as a worsening of the chronic condition. 4. The absence of any phrasing indicating stability or lack of exacerbation of DM2 (e.g., \\'remained stable\\', \\'no worsening\\', or \\'well controlled\\') means the specific fact about perioperative worsening is not addressed.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 14, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Acute lower extremity weakness caused by nerve root compression from neurofibromas, with no evidence of spinal cord compression as shown on MRI.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The summary explicitly states that lower extremity weakness was caused by nerve root compression from neurofibromas (Problem #1: \\'MRI confirmed extensive neurofibromas compressing multiple nerve roots\\'). However, there is no mention of spinal cord compression status on MRI. While nerve root compression is documented, the absence of spinal cord compression is not explicitly stated. The guidelines require explicit mention of all key components of the fact, and since spinal cord compression status is unaddressed, the full fact is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find any explicit mention of viral gastroenteritis as the principal diagnosis at discharge. While the summary does discuss nausea and vomiting as symptoms (Problem #1), it attributes these symptoms to a different clinical picture specifically as contributing factors to AKI. The summary suggests these symptoms were part of a presentation that included hypotension and led to pre renal injury and ATN. Nowhere in the document is there a clear statement that viral gastroenteritis was the principal or final diagnosis. In fact, the symptoms appear to be discussed more in the context of their impact on the patient\\'s kidney function and other comorbidities rather than as a primary viral illness.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the principal diagnosis at discharge was viral gastroenteritis, we need to examine the provided hospital course summary. The summary includes a one liner describing the patient\\'s background, a brief description of the hospital course, outstanding issues, and a problem based summary. The one liner and brief description indicate the patient was admitted with acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to nausea and vomiting, along with hypotension. The problem based summary details the patient\\'s issues, including nausea/vomiting, AKI, hypotension, heart failure, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Throughout the summary, the cause of nausea and vomiting is not explicitly attributed to viral gastroenteritis. The summary focuses on the management and resolution of the patient\\'s symptoms and conditions, primarily AKI and its related issues. There is no mention of viral gastroenteritis as a diagnosis or consideration in the patient\\'s hospital course or discharge summary. Therefore, the fact \\'principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis\\' is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary attributes the patient\\'s AKI to nausea and vomiting, which were managed with antiemetics and fluids. While nausea/vomiting is listed as a problem and the cause of AKI, the summary does not explicitly state \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' as the underlying cause of these symptoms. The principal diagnosis mentioned in the one liner and throughout the summary is AKI due to nausea/vomiting, but no specific cause (e.g., viral, bacterial, or other) for the nausea/vomiting is provided. Since \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' or an equivalent term (e.g., \\'viral enteritis,\\' \\'infectious diarrhea\\') is absent from all sections, the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 15, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** The patient presented with acute kidney injury in the context of a renal transplant, with a serum creatinine level elevated to 3.9 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.4 mg/dL.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions the patient\\'s AKI in the context of a renal transplant (under \\'Relevant Medical History\\' and Problem #2). The serum creatinine elevation to 3.9 mg/dL is clearly stated in Problem #2. However, the baseline creatinine value of 1.4 mg/dL is not explicitly mentioned anywhere in the text. While the summary refers to \\'deterioration from baseline,\\' the specific baseline value (1.4 mg/dL) required by the fact is absent. All other components of the fact are present, but the absence of the numerical baseline creatinine value necessitates a score of 0.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 15, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily stopped when the patient initially came to the hospital.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact about immunosuppressant medications being temporarily stopped is partially mentioned in the summary. Specifically, under Problem #2 (Acute Kidney Injury), the text states they \\'held tacrolimus and mycophenolate pending renal team input.\\' This covers two of the three medications mentioned (tacrolimus and mycophenolate), but there is no explicit mention of prednisone being stopped. Since the fact specifically asks about all three medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, AND prednisone), and prednisone\\'s status is not mentioned, we cannot confirm the complete fact as stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions under Problem #2 (Acute Kidney Injury) that tacrolimus and mycophenolate were held. However, prednisone is not mentioned in the context of being stopped. The fact requires confirmation that all three medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily discontinued. Since prednisone is not referenced in the therapeutic interventions or medication adjustments, the full fact as stated is not explicitly documented. While two of the three medications are addressed, the absence of prednisone in this context means the complete fact is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 16, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Diffuse supratentorial brain metastases with extensive vasogenic edema in bilateral parietal and occipital lobes, right greater than left, were diagnosed on MRI.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'diffuse supratentorial metastases with substantial vasogenic edema\\' and specifies that \\'the largest lesions are in the bilateral parietal and occipital lobes\\' via MRI. However, the summary does not include the detail \\'right greater than left\\' regarding the laterality of the lesions. While all other components of the fact are clearly stated, the absence of this specific comparative laterality (right > left) means the fact as defined is not fully present. A busy physician would note the presence of bilateral involvement but would not find explicit documentation of right sided predominance.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 16, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Currently on high dose dexamethasone and Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find any explicit mention of the patient being on high dose dexamethasone or Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis. While the summary does mention \\'steroids\\' multiple times (e.g., \\'symptoms... were managed with steroids\\' and \\'steroid therapy post surgical intervention\\'), it does not specifically state dexamethasone or its dosing. Similarly, there is no mention of Bactrim or PCP/Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis anywhere in the text. The only medications explicitly mentioned are acetaminophen and levothyroxine. Even though steroid use is documented, the specific details about high dose dexamethasone and the prophylactic use of Bactrim are not present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact \\'Currently on high dose dexamethasone and Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\' is mentioned in the hospital course summary, we need to look for any reference to \\'high dose dexamethasone\\' and \\'Bactrim\\' or \\'Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\'. The summary mentions that the patient\\'s symptoms were managed with \\'steroids\\' and that there are plans to \\'adjust steroid regimen per surgical outcomes\\', indicating the use of steroids. However, it does not explicitly mention \\'high dose dexamethasone\\' or \\'Bactrim\\' or \\'Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\'. The term \\'steroids\\' is used, which could imply dexamethasone but is not specific. There is no mention of \\'Bactrim\\' or its use for \\'Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\'. Therefore, the specific fact is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Searched for \\'dexamethasone\\' or \\'steroids\\' in the summary. Found references to steroids being used for symptom management (headaches/edema) but no specific mention of \\'dexamethasone\\' or \\'high dose\\' steroids. 2. Looked for \\'Bactrim\\' or \\'Pneumocystis prophylaxis\\' in all sections. No references found in medication lists, therapeutic procedures, or discharge plans. 3. While steroids are mentioned generically, the specific drug name (dexamethasone) and dose (high dose) are absent. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii is not addressed at all. 4. The combination of both required elements (dexamethasone at high dose + Bactrim prophylaxis) is not explicitly stated in any form.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 16, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Metastatic breast cancer has progressed, requiring discontinuation of palbociclib\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find an explicit mention of palbociclib or its discontinuation. While the summary does indicate disease progression (evidenced by new brain metastases) and mentions \\'exploration of alternative systemic therapeutic options due to disease progression\\' in the Outstanding Issues section, it does not specifically state that palbociclib was discontinued. The only references to treatment changes are general statements about exploring \\'alternative systemic therapeutic options\\' and \\'alternative cancer treatment regimens.\\' Without explicit mention of palbociclib discontinuation, I cannot mark this fact as present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary indicates that the patient has metastatic breast cancer with new brain metastases, suggesting disease progression. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section mentions \\'Exploration of alternative systemic therapeutic options due to disease progression,\\' which implies that the current treatment is not effective and needs to be changed. Additionally, the \\'Relevant Medical History\\' section lists the patient\\'s history of treatments for metastatic breast cancer, including previous hormone therapy, suggesting that palbociclib (a hormone therapy drug) could have been part of the treatment regimen. However, the summary does not explicitly mention palbociclib or its discontinuation. The closest relevant information is the mention of \\'alternative systemic therapeutic options due to disease progression,\\' which implies a change in treatment due to progression but does not directly state that palbociclib was discontinued.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital summary explicitly states \\'Exploration of alternative systemic therapeutic options due to disease progression\\' under Outstanding Issues, confirming cancer progression. 2. While this implies a treatment change, there is no mention of palbociclib (or any specific medication) being discontinued in any section. 3. The follow up with Medical Oncology to \\'assess alternative cancer treatment regimens\\' suggests therapy modification but does not specify which drug(s) are being changed. 4. The required fact combines both progression and palbociclib discontinuation while progression is documented, the specific drug discontinuation is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 17, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Delirium tremens requiring intravenous benzodiazepines and phenobarbital for symptom control\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** While the summary describes acute alcohol withdrawal with hallucinations and tremors requiring treatment with phenobarbital and ativan, it does not explicitly mention delirium tremens (DT). The treatment approach described (phenobarbital and ativan) is consistent with DT management, but the summary only mentions \\'acute alcohol withdrawal with associated hallucinations and tremors.\\' Without explicit mention of delirium tremens, and following the conservative principle of only marking as present what is explicitly stated, this must be marked as not present. The key elements are there (withdrawal, hallucinations, tremors, IV benzos and phenobarbital) but the specific diagnosis of delirium tremens is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions treatment with phenobarbital IV) and ativan (a benzodiazepine) for alcohol withdrawal with hallucinations and tremors. However, the term \\'delirium tremens\\' is never used in the document. The diagnosis is consistently labeled as \\'alcohol withdrawal with perceptual disturbance,\\' which may represent a less severe form of withdrawal. While the treatment described aligns with delirium tremens management, the absence of explicit documentation of the term itself or unambiguous synonyms (e.g., \\'severe alcohol withdrawal with autonomic instability\\') means the specific fact as phrased is not clearly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Step 1: Searched for mentions of fever Found that patient was admitted for non neutropenic fever. Step 2: Looked for pulmonary infection suspicion Found that broad spectrum antibiotics were given, suggesting infection suspicion. Step 3: Checked for negative workups Found multiple mentions of negative infectious workups: Blood cultures: NGTD (no growth to date) CXR and CT Abdomen showed no infectious focus Step 4: Checked for persistence of fever The summary indicates patient became \\'afebrile 24 hours prior to discharge,\\' suggesting the fever resolved rather than persisted. While there was fever with suspected infection and negative workups initially, the fever did not persist, which is a key component of the fact we\\'re looking for. Therefore, this specific fact is not fully present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states the patient had non neutropenic fever and received empiric antibiotics despite negative infectious workups (blood cultures: NGTD; CXR/CT: no infectious focus). However, the suspected cause for fever was explicitly attributed to \\'increased tumor burden\\' rather than a pulmonary infection. While pulmonary imaging (CXR) was performed and showed no infection, there is no mention of clinical suspicion for a pulmonary infection as the source. The antibiotics were likely initiated for broad coverage rather than targeted pulmonary concern. Thus, while persistent fever and negative workups are present, the specific suspicion of a pulmonary infection is not stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 18, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma recently complicated by progression to CNS lymphoma\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'high grade B cell lymphoma with CNS progression\\' in the Brief Description and \\'History of CNS lymphoma\\' in the Relevant Medical History. However, the specific term \\'Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma\\' (DLBCL) is not explicitly stated. While high grade B cell lymphoma is a category that includes DLBCL, the summary does not confirm this subtype. The MYC/BCL2 translocation noted in the medical history is associated with high grade lymphomas but does not definitively equate to DLBCL. Since the fact requires explicit mention of DLBCL (or a clear synonym), which is absent, the fact is not fully stated as phrased.\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 18, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'acute kidney injury (AKI)\\' as resolved with fluid resuscitation (Problem #3). Hypokalemia is documented as a separate issue (Problem #4) with low potassium levels (3.3 3.4) treated via oral supplementation and described as \\'responsive to treatment.\\' However, the summary confirms resolution of AKI but does not explicitly state that hypokalemia itself was fully resolved during admission. While both conditions are addressed, the phrase \\'acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved\\' (as a combined statement) is not present, and hypokalemia\\'s resolution is implied but not definitively declared. Thus, the specific fact as phrased is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**34. Patient 19, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis).\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, the specific fact about hydronephrosis being complicated by UTIs with ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis is not fully present. While the summary does mention: 1. UTIs and specifically E. faecalis in cultures 2. A history of ESBL producing organisms (implied by the initial choice of ertapenem) 3. A filling defect in the left renal pole However, the summary does not explicitly mention: 1. Hydronephrosis 2. Klebsiella infection 3. Current ESBL E. coli infection While there are elements of urinary tract infections and some of the specified organisms, the complete fact as stated, particularly the presence of hydronephrosis and its relationship to these specific infections, is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s admission for a urinary tract infection associated with a cystostomy catheter. It mentions that the patient has a history of recurrent UTIs and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and that E. faecalis was identified in urine cultures. The summary also references past ESBL producing organisms. The CT imaging showed a filling defect in the left renal pole, which could be indicative of hydronephrosis or another issue, although \\'hydronephrosis\\' is not directly stated. The presence of UTIs with ESBL E. coli (implied by \\'past ESBL producing organisms\\'), Klebsiella (not directly mentioned but possible given the context of recurrent UTIs and ESBL organisms), and Enterococcus faecalis is documented. Thus, while \\'hydronephrosis\\' is not explicitly mentioned, the clinical context suggests its possibility. The fact that urinary tract infections are complicated by ESBL E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis is explicitly mentioned or strongly implied.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary mentions recurrent UTIs with E. faecalis and past ESBL producing organisms (though not specifically E. coli or Klebsiella in this admission). 2. Hydronephrosis is not explicitly mentioned in any part of the document. The CT finding describes a \\'filling defect in the left renal pole\\' but does not use the term hydronephrosis or describe urinary obstruction. 3. While neurogenic bladder and suprapubic catheter (known risk factors for hydronephrosis) are documented, the summary does not state that hydronephrosis exists or that it is complicated by infections with the specified organisms. 4. The pathogens listed in the target fact (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterococcus) are only partially matched E. faecalis is present, but ESBL organisms are only referenced historically, and Klebsiella is not mentioned in this admission\\'s culture results.\\n\\n\\n\\n**35. Patient 19, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Chronic opioid use and opioid-related constipation. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions chronic opioid use in multiple places. Specifically: 1. Under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' there is a note for \\'Chronic pain management and addiction medicine referral\\' 2. Under \\'Problem #3: Chronic Pain and Opioid Use\\', the summary states \\'chronic opioid dependency acknowledged\\' and discusses ongoing pain management with oral hydromorphone 3. The discharge plan includes coordination with addiction medicine and establishing outpatient chronic pain management However, while opioid use is clearly documented, opioid related constipation is not explicitly mentioned anywhere in the summary. There is no discussion of bowel movements, constipation, or GI side effects from opioid use.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly mentions \\'chronic opioid use\\' in Problem #3 (Chronic Pain and Opioid Use), stating \\'chronic opioid dependency acknowledged\\' and \\'oral hydromorphone for pain management.\\' 2. No mention of opioid related constipation is found in any section. While constipation is a common opioid side effect, the text does not reference bowel complications, constipation, or gastrointestinal issues related to opioids in the hospital course, discharge plans, or problem lists. 3. The combination of chronic opioid use AND opioid related constipation as a single fact is not explicitly stated. Only the opioid use component is documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**36. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary mentions \\'progressive thrombocytopenia\\' in the one liner, which is a direct synonym for \\'worsening thrombocytopenia\\'. 2. Under Problem #2: Thrombocytopenia, it states \\'Prednisone initially 40 mg, increased to 100 mg daily\\' and \\'Continue prednisone 100 mg daily\\' in the discharge plan. However, there is no mention of a prednisone taper being initiated (taper implies dose reduction, while the documentation shows dose escalation followed by maintenance). 3. While corticosteroid treatment and dose changes are documented, the specific concept of a \\'prednisone taper initiation\\' (a planned dose reduction strategy) is not explicitly stated in any section.\\n\\n\\n\\n**37. Patient 20, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, particularly focusing on the discharge plans and follow up sections, there is no explicit mention of ordering twice weekly CBCs after discharge. While the summary does mention follow up CBC monitoring in several places (e.g., \\'follow up CBC and differential\\' under Problem #2\\'s discharge plan), it does not specify the frequency as twice weekly. The closest reference is under \\'Problem #2: Thrombocytopenia\\' where it mentions to \\'Continue prednisone 100 mg daily, follow up CBC and differential,\\' but this does not specify twice weekly monitoring. The frequency of CBC monitoring is not explicitly stated anywhere in the document.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact \\'Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\' is explicitly mentioned, I analyzed the provided hospital course summary. The summary is divided into several sections, including a one liner, brief description of hospital course, outstanding issues/follow up, problem based summary, relevant medical history, relevant surgical history, and additional requirements. I looked for any mention of CBC frequency post discharge. In the \\'Problem Based Summary\\' under \\'Problem #2: Thrombocytopenia,\\' the \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' section states \\'follow up CBC and differential.\\' Although it does not specify \\'twice weekly,\\' it implies that CBC monitoring is required post discharge. However, the exact frequency is not mentioned. The \\'Outstanding/Pending Issues\\' section for Thrombocytopenia mentions \\'Monitor for platelet response to corticosteroid therapy,\\' which suggests ongoing monitoring but again does not specify the frequency. Since the exact phrase \\'twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\' or an equivalent is not found, I conclude that the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions under Problem #2 (Thrombocytopenia) discharge plan: \\'follow up CBC and differential\\' and \\'Evaluate need for additional treatment based on CBC results.\\' However, there is no explicit mention of the frequency (twice weekly) for these CBCs. While monitoring CBCs is clearly part of the follow up plan, the specific instruction for twice weekly frequency is absent from all sections of the summary, including discharge plans, outstanding issues, and additional requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\n**38. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The summary mentions recurrent falls multiple times, but does not explicitly state that they are of unknown etiology despite extensive workup. While the summary shows that diagnostic investigations were performed (including telemetry showing runs of nonsustained SVT, and imaging confirming T6 compression fracture), it does not indicate that the underlying cause remained unknown or that the workup was extensive yet inconclusive. In fact, some potential contributing factors are identified (gait instability, cardiac issues). The hospital course describes evaluations for recurrent falls but does not specify that the etiology remained unclear despite thorough investigation. Therefore, while recurrent falls are clearly documented, the specific element of \\'unknown etiology despite extensive workup\\' is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states \\'recurrent falls\\' as a reason for admission and details evaluations including imaging, telemetry, and consultations. However, there is no explicit mention that the etiology remains unknown despite an inpatient workup. The summary notes findings (T6 fracture, NSVT) and interventions (PT, medication adjustments) but does not state that the cause of falls was undetermined after evaluation. While workup\\' occurred, the specific fact of \\'unknown etiology despite extensive workup\\' is not articulated in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**39. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention that the T6 wedge compression fracture likely occurred before the most recent fall. The summary mentions the T6 compression fracture multiple times, particularly in Problem #1 and Problem #2 sections, but only describes it as being discovered after the current fall admission. In Problem #2, it\\'s specifically referred to as a \\'new T6 compression deformity,\\' which actually suggests this is a recent injury rather than a pre existing condition. The temporal relationship suggesting the fracture predated the most recent fall is not stated anywhere in the text. While there is discussion of \\'recurrent falls,\\' this doesn\\'t establish when the T6 fracture occurred in relation to these falls.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions a T6 compression fracture multiple times, but it does not explicitly state that the fracture likely happened before the most recent fall. The \\'One Liner\\' and \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' sections indicate that the T6 compression fracture occurred as a result of the fall. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' under \\'Problem #2: T6 Wedge Compression Fracture\\' describes it as a \\'new T6 compression deformity,\\' suggesting it was associated with the recent fall. There is no explicit mention that the fracture occurred before the most recent fall.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states that Mrs. Mallonee was admitted \\'following a fall resulting in a T6 compression fracture\\' and describes the fracture as a \\'new T6 compression deformity\\' in the problem based summary. These phrases directly attribute the fracture to the recent fall that prompted admission. While the summary documents recurrent falls as a broader issue, there is no mention of the T6 fracture being pre existing or occurring prior to the most recent fall. The absence of any qualifiers (e.g., \\'chronic,\\' \\'old,\\' or \\'prior\\') or comparative imaging findings to suggest an older fracture supports the conclusion that the fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**40. Patient 21, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Increased to metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find an explicit mention of increasing metoprolol succinate to 50 mg daily. While the summary does mention metoprolol in the Heart Failure section (\\'Adjusted metoprolol dosage\\'), it does not specify the exact change to 50 mg daily. The document only indicates that there was some adjustment to the metoprolol dosage without providing the specific details of the dose change. Therefore, while medication adjustment occurred, the specific fact we\\'re looking for (increase to metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily) is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if the fact \\'Increased to metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily\\' is explicitly mentioned. Under Problem #3: Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF), it is stated that \\'Adjusted metoprolol dosage\\' was performed as part of the therapeutic procedures. However, the specific dosage or the fact that it was increased to 50 mg daily is not mentioned. Therefore, the exact fact is not explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary under Problem #3 (HFrEF) states: \\'Adjusted metoprolol dosage; continued Lasix.\\' While this confirms a dosage adjustment was made, the summary does not explicitly specify the exact new regimen of \\'metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily.\\' The phrase \\'adjusted\\' could imply either an increase or decrease, and no numerical dose or frequency is provided. There is no mention of \\'50 mg daily\\' or equivalent phrasing elsewhere in the document. The absence of these specific details means the fact is not explicitly stated, though a dosage change is acknowledged.\\n\\n\\n\\n**41. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary in detail, there is no explicit mention of Augmentin therapy or its planned 14 day duration. While the summary does mention antibiotic therapy (specifically Zosyn for cholangitis) and includes statements about \\'continuation of empiric antibiotic therapy until infection resolves\\' in the Outstanding Issues section, it does not specifically discuss Augmentin or any plans to re evaluate its continuation prior to a 14 day completion. The antibiotic discussions in the text are more general and focus on different antimicrobial therapy (Zosyn).\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'Augmentin therapy\\' or the decision to continue or re evaluate it prior to the 14 day completion. The summary does mention \\'Continuation of empiric antibiotic therapy until infection resolves\\' under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\', but it specifies that the patient was treated with intravenous Zosyn, not Augmentin. There is no clear indication or mention of Augmentin in the provided summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions treatment with intravenous Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) for cholangitis and states \\'Continuation of empiric antibiotic therapy until infection resolves\\' in the discharge plan. However, there is no mention of Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate) therapy in any section of the summary. The instruction to \\'re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\' is absent, as the antibiotic regimen described involves Zosyn rather than Augmentin. No equivalent phrasing or clinical synonyms for Augmentin therapy or a 14 day re evaluation are present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**42. Patient 22, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** patient should follow up with Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/ Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Poultsides, George, MD in in 2 weeks\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary thoroughly, including the One Liner, Brief Description, Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section, and Problem Based Summary, there is no explicit mention of follow up appointments with either an Advanced Practice Provider in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides, George, MD in 2 weeks. While the summary does mention several follow up requirements (including outpatient SLP, Nutrition Cancer Center, oncology follow up, and hepatic surgeons), it does not specify these particular providers or these specific timeframes. The closest mentions are general follow up recommendations without specific timing or provider details.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s hospital stay, diagnosis, treatment, and follow up plans. To determine if the specific fact about follow up appointments is mentioned, we need to look for any reference to scheduling follow ups with an Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant) and Dr. Poultsides, George, MD. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists several follow up plans, including outpatient oncology follow up and other care continuations, but does not explicitly mention a follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider or Dr. Poultsides, George, MD within the specified timeframe (1 week and 2 weeks respectively). The discharge plan and goals for various problems are discussed, but none directly state the required follow up appointments.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary\\'s \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section and problem based discharge plans mention follow ups with oncology, SLP, nutrition services, hepatic surgeons, IR, and endocrine specialists. However, there is no explicit reference to a follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant) in 1 week or with \\'Poultsides, George, MD\\' in 2 weeks. The name \\'Poultsides\\' does not appear in the text, and the term \\'Advanced Practice Provider\\' (or its synonyms/abbreviations) is absent. While follow ups are broadly recommended, the specific providers and timeframes in the fact are not stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**43. Patient 23, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. The summary is analyzed section by section to identify if this specific fact or its equivalent is mentioned. The \\'One Liner\\' section introduces the patient with a history of CLL and heart failure. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' section details the patient\\'s issues, including CLL and heart failure exacerbation with mitral valve stenosis. While CLL is discussed, the term \\'progressing CLL\\' is not directly stated; however, significant leukocytosis is noted. For mitral valvulopathy, the summary mentions \\'mitral valve stenosis\\' with a mitral valve gradient of 25 on TTE, indicating its presence. The summary does not explicitly state \\'progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\' together, but it does discuss both conditions separately. The closest related information is found under \\'Problem #1: CLL\\' and \\'Problem #2: Heart Failure Exacerbation and Mitral Valve Stenosis\\'. Although \\'mitral valvulopathy\\' is not a direct synonym for \\'mitral valve stenosis\\', it can be considered related as both pertain to mitral valve issues. The fact is not explicitly mentioned in the exact wording, but relevant information is present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'Rai Stage II Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)\\' under Problem #1, but does not describe the CLL as \\'progressing.\\' The current clinical status states \\'disease is stable,\\' which contradicts progression. 2. Mitral valvulopathy is addressed under Problem #2 as \\'Mitral Valve Stenosis\\' (a specific type of valvulopathy) with details about valve gradient and management. However, the fact requires both \\'progressing CLL\\' and \\'mitral valvulopathy\\' to be mentioned together. While mitral valve pathology is documented, the absence of explicit or implicit evidence of CLL progression (e.g., rising WBC, treatment escalation for progression, or clinical deterioration) means the combined context is not stated. Thus, the specific fact is not fully present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**44. Patient 23, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find any explicit mention of cardiology coordinating follow up with the Heart Failure team specifically to discuss transcatheter MVR or a new clinical trial drug for 4/2023. While the summary does mention cardiology follow up in several places (e.g., \\'Follow up with cardiology for heart valve assessment and management\\' and \\'Ongoing cardiology follow up for comprehensive valve disease management\\'), it does not specify the particular details about transcatheter MVR or a clinical trial drug. The summary discusses the patient\\'s mitral valve issues and previous valve replacement, but does not mention future plans for transcatheter MVR or any clinical trials. This level of specific planning is not documented in the provided text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, it is clear that while there are mentions of cardiology follow up and management of heart failure and valve disease, the specific details about \\'transcatheter MVR iso\\' and \\'new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\' are not present. The summary does mention \\'follow up with cardiology for heart valve assessment and management\\' and \\'ongoing cardiology follow up for comprehensive valve disease management\\', indicating that cardiology follow up is planned. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific fact regarding transcatheter MVR or a new clinical trial drug. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions cardiology follow up for heart valve assessment and management, and comprehensive valve disease management. However, there is no explicit mention of coordination with the Heart Failure team, transcatheter MVR (mitral valve replacement), or a new clinical trial drug from April 2023. While cardiology follow up is planned, the specific details about the Heart Failure team involvement, transcatheter intervention, or clinical trial drug are absent from the text. The summary does not contain equivalent phrases or abbreviations for these specific elements.\\n\\n\\n\\n**45. Patient 24, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** this (and prior) small bowel obstruction managed nonoperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly states the current SBO was managed with \\'non operative management\\' including NGT decompression and bowel rest. 2. The patient\\'s history of \\'multiple prior SBOs\\' is documented, but there is no explicit mention of how those previous episodes were managed. 3. While the current non operative approach is clearly described, the summary does not contain any statement indicating prior SBOs were also managed nonoperatively (either directly or through equivalent phrasing). 4. The combination of this and prior SBOs being managed nonoperatively is not fully addressed, as prior management remains unspecified.\\n\\n\\n\\n**46. Patient 24, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary step by step to determine if discharge on full liquid diet and oral pain medications was explicitly mentioned: 1. Regarding diet: The summary mentions \\'started on a full liquid diet\\' under Problem #1 The discharge plan mentions \\'Gradually advance diet as tolerated\\' However, it does not explicitly state the diet status at discharge 2. Regarding pain medications: While \\'pain control\\' is mentioned as part of management There is no explicit mention of discharge pain medications The discharge plan does not specify medication regimen While both diet and pain management were part of the hospital course, the specific fact of being discharged on full liquid diet AND oral pain medications is not explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** Step 1: Search for \\'full liquid diet\\' Found in Problem #1\\'s \\'Current Clinical Status\\' section: \\'started on a full liquid diet.\\' Step 2: Search for \\'oral pain medications\\' The summary mentions \\'pain control\\' in the Brief Description and Problem #1 management, but never specifies the route (oral) or discharge prescription of pain medications. While dietary modifications at discharge are documented, the discharge plan only mentions diet advancement without specifying pain medication administration method. The combination of both elements (full liquid diet AND oral pain medications) is required for the fact. Only one component is explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**47. Patient 25, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, the specific fact about the upper GI series, famotidine/PPI treatment, and GI consultation with recommendations for EGD/ERCP is not explicitly mentioned in the text. While the summary does mention GI follow up as an outstanding issue \\'for further evaluation of duodenitis and CBD narrowing,\\' and includes references to gastrointestinal procedures in the patient\\'s surgical history, it does not contain the specific details about the upper GI series findings, medication changes from famotidine to PPI, or the GI consultants\\' specific recommendations regarding EGD/ERCP. The only related information is a brief mention under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' stating \\'GI follow up for further evaluation of duodenitis and CBD narrowing,\\' but this does not include the specific details we\\'re looking for.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, there is no mention of the Upper GI series, the administration of IV famotidine, switching to PPI BID, or the discussion with GI specialists regarding EGD/ERCP and empiric PPI. The summary does mention \\'GI follow up for further evaluation of duodenitis and CBD narrowing\\' under Outstanding Issues/Follow Up, which indicates some gastrointestinal evaluation but does not directly state the fact in question. Therefore, the specific details about the Upper GI series and subsequent management are not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention the upper GI series results, initiation of IV famotidine/PPI, or discussions deferring EGD/ERCP. While GI follow up for \\'duodenitis and CBD narrowing\\' is noted, there is no reference to the specific imaging findings (no obstruction), medication transitions (famotidine → PPI BID), or advanced GI recommendations (empiric PPI for 8 weeks, outpatient ERCP planning). These elements are critical to the fact in question and are absent across all sections of the summary, including diagnostic investigations, therapeutic interventions, and discharge plans.\\n\\n\\n\\n**48. Patient 25, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) on admission or its treatment with fluids and resolution. While there is a brief mention in the Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section to \\'Monitor kidney function and hydrate adequately,\\' this is a forward looking instruction rather than a description of past AKI treatment. The summary covers multiple problems in detail (pancreatic cancer, ascites, portal vein thrombosis, and malnutrition) but does not include any discussion of kidney injury at admission or its treatment course. Even reviewing the Brief Description of Hospital Course and all problem based summaries, there is no indication of admission AKI or its management with fluids.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved.\\' To determine this, I reviewed the provided summary, focusing on sections that might discuss kidney function or fluid management. The \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' and \\'Problem Based Summary\\' sections were examined for any mention of acute kidney injury (AKI), fluid treatment, or related conditions. While the summary does mention \\'Monitor kidney function and hydrate adequately\\' under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up,\\' this does not directly indicate that AKI was present on admission or treated with fluids. There is no explicit mention of AKI or its treatment in the provided text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed systematically. The \\'AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved\\' fact was evaluated by checking all sections (One Liner, Brief Description, Outstanding Issues, Problem Based Summaries). While \\'monitor kidney function and hydrate adequately\\' is listed under Outstanding Issues, there is no explicit mention of AKI (acute kidney injury) being present on admission, nor any documentation of fluid administration specifically for AKI resolution. The text references hydration as a precaution but does not link it to a resolved AKI episode. No abbreviations (e.g., AKI) or clinical synonyms for acute kidney injury appear in the summary. The absence of AKI is further confirmed by its omission from all problem based summaries and therapeutic interventions.\\n\\n\\n\\n**49. Patient 26, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Metoprolol dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily for improved rate control; Apixaban dosage increased to 5 mg twice daily for anticoagulation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, the specific fact about metoprolol being increased to 75mg twice daily and apixaban being increased to 5mg twice daily is not explicitly mentioned. While the summary does mention rate control medications (including metoprolol) being used and adjusted (\\'rate control with diltiazem and metoprolol\\' and \\'rate improved with medication adjustments\\'), it does not specify the exact dosage changes. Similarly, there is no mention of apixaban or its dosage adjustment anywhere in the text. The closest related information is in Problem #2 regarding atrial fibrillation/flutter management, but it only mentions rate control medications without specific dosing details.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if the specific fact \\'Metoprolol dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily for improved rate control; Apixaban dosage increased to 5 mg twice daily for anticoagulation\\' was explicitly mentioned. The summary details the patient\\'s treatment for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter, including rate control with diltiazem and metoprolol, but does not specify the dosage of metoprolol or any adjustments made to it. Additionally, there is no mention of apixaban or its dosage in the provided summary. Therefore, the specific fact regarding the increase in metoprolol and apixaban dosages is not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'rate control with diltiazem and metoprolol\\' and states that \\'rate improved with medication adjustments\\' under Problem #2 (Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter). However, there is no explicit mention of a metoprolol dosage increase to 75 mg twice daily. Similarly, while anticoagulation is implied in the context of atrial fibrillation management, apixaban is never mentioned in the document, and no dosage adjustments for anticoagulants are described. The summary only references general \\'medication adjustments\\' without specifying these exact dosage changes.\\n\\n\\n\\n**50. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** While reviewing the hospital course summary, I found the following relevant information: 1. The summary mentions SMA (superior mesenteric artery) narrowing in Problem #1 under \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\': \\'CT showed SMA narrowing but ruled out acute ischemia.\\' 2. The patient\\'s presenting symptoms included severe nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain. 3. However, the summary does not explicitly state or suggest that the patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia. In fact, the CT findings specifically ruled out acute ischemia, and the symptoms are attributed to gastroparesis throughout the summary. 4. While SMA narrowing is mentioned, the connection between this finding and the patient\\'s symptoms is not made in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'CT showed SMA narrowing\\' under Problem #1 (Gastroparesis/Dyspepsia) diagnostic investigations. However, it states this finding \\'ruled out acute ischemia\\' and does not explicitly link the SMA stenosis to chronic mesenteric ischemia as a potential cause of emesis. While SMA stenosis is documented, the summary attributes the vomiting to gastroparesis (with planned GI follow up for this) rather than mesenteric ischemia. The connection between emesis and chronic mesenteric ischemia via SMA stenosis is not made in any section of the discharge plan, or problem based summaries.\\n\\n\\n\\n**51. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details a 44 year old male with AML admitted for neutropenic fever. The summary indicates that blood cultures showed Coagulase Negative Staphylococci bacteremia, and the patient underwent PICC line removal as part of the therapeutic procedures for neutropenic fever. The patient was treated with various antibiotics, including a transition to linezolid after discharge. The fact to be verified is whether the patient was admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia and treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics. The summary confirms admission for neutropenic fever and treatment with PICC removal and antibiotics. However, it specifies \\'Coagulase Negative Staphylococci bacteremia\\' rather than \\'coagulase negative strep bacteremia,\\' indicating a difference in the type of bacteria identified. The summary does mention PICC line removal but only implies replacement in the \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section. The treatment included various antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions neutropenic fever as the admission reason and details Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (CoNS) bacteremia identified via blood cultures. However, the fact specifies \\'coagulase negative strep\\' (streptococcus), which is a different organism from Staphylococci. While PICC removal and antibiotic treatment (including vancomycin and linezolid) are documented, the summary does not mention streptococcus bacteremia. Since \\'strep\\' and \\'staph\\' are distinct genera with no clinical synonymity, the specific fact about coagulase negative strep bacteremia is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**52. Patient 27, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that \\'TTE showed no vegetations\\' under Problem #1: Neutropenic Fever. However, it does not specify the date of the TTE. The fact to be verified is \\'TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations.\\' Since the date \\'3/6/23\\' is not mentioned in the summary, and there\\'s no explicit mention of a TTE on that specific date, we cannot confirm the fact. The summary does mention a TTE without vegetations, but without the date, it\\'s not a direct match.\\n\\n\\n\\n**53. Patient 27, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact about tonsillitis imaging and treatment is partially mentioned in the summary. Specifically: 1. The CT maxillofacial imaging showing \\'signs suggestive of tonsillitis\\' is explicitly mentioned under Problem #1 (Neutropenic Fever). 2. The summary mentions antibiotic treatment (initially Zosyn, then Cefepime and Vancomycin), but these were primarily started for neutropenic fever rather than being explicitly linked to treating tonsillitis. 3. While imaging findings of tonsillitis are mentioned, localizing symptoms are not explicitly described. 4. The antibiotics given could have treated tonsillitis, but the text doesn\\'t explicitly state this was their purpose. Since the complete combination of imaging, localizing symptoms, and explicit antibiotic treatment specifically for tonsillitis is not fully present, this fact cannot be considered completely mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'CT maxillofacial showed [...] signs suggestive of tonsillitis\\' under Problem #1\\'s diagnostic investigations, fulfilling the imaging component. Antibiotic treatment (Zosyn, Cefepime, Vancomycin, and planned linezolid) is documented in therapeutic procedures. However, there is no explicit mention of localizing symptoms (e.g., sore throat, dysphagia) that prompted the imaging. While the imaging finding and antibiotic treatment are clearly stated, the absence of documented localizing symptoms means the full fact (imaging + symptoms + antibiotics) is not explicitly present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**54. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step: 1. The text mentions that the patient underwent \\'multiple biliary drain exchanges\\' and had \\'persistent hyperbilirubinemia.\\' 2. PTBD (percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage) exchanges are specifically mentioned under Problem #1. 3. The text indicates that there was \\'limited further intervention potential\\' and the patient was \\'transitioned to hospice care focusing on comfort.\\' 4. While these elements align with the fact we\\'re looking for, the text does not explicitly state that the bilirubin failed to improve despite the PTBD exchanges. The temporal relationship between the persistent hyperbilirubinemia and the decision to transition to hospice is implied but not explicitly stated as cause and effect. 5. The transition to home hospice is clearly mentioned in multiple places, including the \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section and the \\'Discharge Plan and Goals.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n**55. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Analyzing the hospital course summary for the specified complications: 1. Sepsis requiring antibiotics and fluid resuscitation: While the summary mentions dehydration and hypotension with IV fluid administration, it does not explicitly mention sepsis or antibiotic therapy 2. Delirium requiring pharmacotherapy: Delirium is mentioned in Problem #3, but the summary only states it was \\'managed with routine medication\\' without specifying pharmacotherapy 3. Urinary retention requiring catheter: No mention of urinary retention or catheter placement anywhere in the summary While some elements are partially present (delirium, fluid administration), the specific combination of sepsis with antibiotics, delirium with pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention with catheter is not explicitly documented in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides a detailed overview of Mr. Green\\'s hospitalization. To determine if the specific fact is mentioned, we need to check for mentions of \\'sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation\\', \\'delirium requiring pharmacotherapy\\', and \\'urinary retention requiring urinary catheter\\'. The summary indicates that the patient had dehydration and hypotension, for which he received IV fluids, suggesting fluid resuscitation. It also mentions delirium, which was managed with routine medication, indicating pharmacotherapy. However, there is no explicit mention of \\'sepsis requiring antibiotics\\' or \\'urinary retention requiring urinary catheter\\'. Thus, the fact is not entirely mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis: The summary mentions \\'recurrent cholangitis\\' (a biliary infection) and \\'aggressive IV fluids\\' for hypotension/dehydration, but does not explicitly state \\'sepsis\\' or mention antibiotics. While cholangitis can lead to sepsis, the term \\'sepsis\\' itself is absent. 2. Delirium: Explicitly stated in Problem #3 with \\'managed with routine medication,\\' satisfying the pharmacotherapy requirement. 3. Urinary retention: No mention of urinary retention or catheter placement in any section. Only 1/3 components (delirium) are explicitly documented. Since the fact components are conjunctive (all required), the full fact is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**56. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, while it mentions that the patient has nasopharyngeal carcinoma with cervical nodal metastases and experienced delirium during the admission, it does not explicitly state that management of the metastatic cancer was deferred to outpatient oncology due to the son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium. The summary only mentions \\'Consider chemotherapy plan based on patient and family decision\\' under Problem #1 and notes outpatient oncological follow up, but does not specifically indicate that management was deferred due to the son\\'s wishes or the patient\\'s delirium. While both delirium and cancer management are discussed separately, their causal relationship in deferring treatment is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states that chemotherapy planning for nasopharyngeal carcinoma is pending \\'patient and family decision\\' and mentions the patient\\'s delirium. However, there is no explicit mention of management being deferred to the outpatient oncologist specifically due to the son\\'s wishes. While outpatient oncological follow up is planned, the text does not directly link this deferral to the son\\'s input or the patient\\'s delirium as a contributing factor. The family\\'s role in decision making is acknowledged, but the specific combination of \\'son\\'s wishes\\' and \\'delirium\\' as reasons for deferral is not clearly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**57. Patient 29, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** While the summary mentions aspiration risk and aspiration precautions multiple times, it does not explicitly state that the patient developed a temporary oxygen requirement due to aspiration pneumonitis. The closest references are: 1) Under Problem #4, it mentions \\'maintaining oxygen requirements\\' but doesn\\'t specify if this was new or temporary, 2) There\\'s mention of \\'aspiration and respiratory issues\\' and \\'aspiration related atelectasis\\' but not specifically pneumonitis, 3) The summary does note that the patient was made \\'Strict NPO\\' with PEG feeding (in Outstanding Issues/Follow Up), but doesn\\'t explicitly connect this to an oxygen requirement or pneumonitis event. While there are hints at respiratory issues and aspiration concerns, the specific fact we\\'re looking for a temporary O2 requirement caused by aspiration pneumonitis leading to NPO status is not explicitly stated in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. The summary is analyzed in sections. The \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' mentions that the patient experienced \\'intermittent delirium and aspiration risk,\\' which improved with management. Under \\'Problem #4: Aspiration and Respiratory Issues,\\' it is noted that there were \\'concerns of aspiration related atelectasis\\' and that the patient was \\'maintaining oxygen requirements.\\' The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section includes \\'Aspiration precautions: Strict NPO with PEG feeding.\\' While the summary does not directly state \\'aspiration pneumonitis,\\' it implies aspiration related issues and mentions strict NPO status, aligning with parts of the fact. However, it does not explicitly mention \\'temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis.\\' The closest relevant information is under \\'Problem #4,\\' indicating the patient had oxygen requirements and concerns of aspiration related issues. The fact that the patient was made \\'strict NPO\\' is directly mentioned, attributed to aspiration precautions. The absence of the specific phrase \\'felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis\\' and attribution to \\'SLP\\' for making the patient \\'strict NPO\\' means the fact is not explicitly mentioned in its entirety.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary mentions \\'strict NPO with PEG feeding\\' under Aspiration precautions, which addresses the NPO component. 2. Under Problem #4 (Aspiration and Respiratory Issues), it states \\'maintaining oxygen requirements\\' but attributes this to \\'aspiration related atelectasis\\' rather than pneumonitis. 3. While aspiration risk and oxygen requirements are mentioned, the specific terms \\'aspiration pneumonitis\\' and SLP involvement in NPO orders are not explicitly stated. 4. The oxygen requirement is linked to atelectasis (a different pathology) and SLP\\'s role in NPO implementation isn\\'t documented, making the fact as phrased not fully present.\\n\\n\\n\\n### B.

All Inconsistent Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 0, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left-sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions \\'drain removal\\' in the Problem #1 section: \\'amylase levels normalized leading to drain removal\\' 2. This directly contradicts the Important Fact stating that a \\'Left sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\' 3. Both statements cannot be true either the drain was removed or it was left in place at discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary does not mention the presence or status of a left sided abdominal JP drain at discharge. The \\'Important Fact\\' states that a left sided abdominal JP drain was left at the time of discharge. The summary mentions that \\'amylase levels normalized leading to drain removal,\\' which implies that at least one drain was removed, but it does not explicitly state that all drains were removed or specify the location and number of drains. However, the absence of any mention of a left sided JP drain being left in place at discharge suggests a potential inconsistency.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states a left sided abdominal JP drain was left at discharge. 2. The Hospital Course Summary under Problem #1\\'s Current Clinical Status explicitly states \\'amylase levels normalized leading to drain removal.\\' 3. Removal of the drain directly contradicts the fact that it was left in place at discharge. Both statements cannot be true simultaneously.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 1, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypoxia 2/2 recurrent R pleura effusion\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states hypoxia is due to recurrent right pleural effusion. 2. Summary\\'s Problem #2 attributes hypoxia to \\'baseline pulmonary status\\' and post procedural desaturation, but Problem #1 confirms the effusion decreased post treatment and loculations persisted. 3. No explicit mention of recurrence of effusion causing hypoxia; instead, hypoxia is linked to unresolved loculations and OSA/CO2 retention. 4. Thus, the summary does not confirm hypoxia is specifically due to recurrent effusion, creating a contradiction with the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 2, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed. Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down\\' and \\'obstructing necrotic mass removed\\' alongside small bowel resection. 2. Hospital Summary explicitly mentions \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' and removal of a \\'necrotic mass in the small bowel\\' but does not document adhesiolysis. 3. Since the summary omits adhesions being addressed (a distinct procedure from the resection itself), these statements cannot both be true.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 3, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** R-sided chest pain 2/2 port-associated thrombus\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states R sided chest pain is due to port associated thrombus (2/2 = secondary to). 2. Hospital Summary (Problem #2: Cancer related Pain) attributes R sided chest pain to metastases, not thrombus. 3. Port associated thrombus (Problem #3) is documented but not linked to chest pain in the summary. 4. Attribution of chest pain to metastases directly contradicts the fact\\'s stated cause (thrombus).\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 4, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement,\\' indicating an acute kidney injury (AKI) superimposed on chronic kidney disease (CKD) caused by urinary retention. 2. The Hospital Course Summary documents CKD IV (stage IV) and urinary retention managed with a foley but does not mention AKI at any point. 3. Lab values (Cr 3.64 3.80 mg/dL) are presented as a stable range without reference to an acute rise from baseline, and the summary explicitly describes \\'stable kidney function post foley.\\' 4. The absence of AKI documentation in the summary directly contradicts the assertion of AKI in the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the adrenal crisis was likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. The Hospital Course Summary does not mention \\'PO prednisone\\' or any issue related to prednisone intolerance. Instead, it details the patient\\'s treatment with intravenous hydrocortisone and subsequent transition to oral hydrocortisone, indicating a different management approach.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states the patient is being discharged on \\'Levemir 16 UNITS BID\\' (twice daily) 2. The Important Fact states lantus 15 units twice daily 3. These are different insulins (Levemir vs. Lantus) and different doses (16 units vs. 15 units) 4. While both are long acting insulins given twice daily, the specific medication and dosage differences make these statements contradictory\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions that the patient was discharged on \\'Levemir 16 UNITS BID and Insulin 1:7 TID AC\\', whereas the Important Fact states that insulin was changed to \\'lantus 15units twice a day\\'. The discrepancy lies in the type and dosage of insulin. Levemir and Lantus are both long acting insulins but are different brands. The dosage also differs (16 units vs 15 units). Therefore, the summary contradicts the fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states insulin changed to Lantus 15 units twice daily. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s Problem #2 discharge plan specifies \\'Levemir 16 UNITS BID\\' (a different basal insulin). 3. Lantus and Levemir are distinct insulin formulations. 4. Dosage (15 vs 16 units) and medication type (Lantus vs Levemir) both differ. 5. This constitutes a direct therapeutic regimen contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 7, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left renal cell carcinoma status-post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post-op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact mentions \\'status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\' for renal cell carcinoma. 2. The Hospital Course Summary describes the patient\\'s surgery (nephrectomy/IVC thrombectomy) but never references neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the Problem #1 section, Therapeutic Procedures, or Medical History. 3. Since neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a major pretreatment modality that would typically be documented in a surgical summary if administered, its absence creates a direct contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 7, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Continued on apixaban post-op\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the patient \\'continued on apixaban post op.\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary explicitly states under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' to \\'Restart home apixaban (Eliquis) for DVT prevention\\' and under Problem #1\\'s Discharge Plan to \\'resume apixaban.\\' 3. \\'Restart\\' and \\'resume\\' imply a temporary discontinuation (e.g., perioperative hold) followed by re initiation, which conflicts with the assertion of uninterrupted continuation (\\'continued on\\').\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 8, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Down\\'s syndrome, neurogenic bladder, admitted for pneumonia, treated with CAP regimen and vancomycin due to positive sputum culture for MRSA\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states MRSA was found in sputum culture, prompting vancomycin. 2. Hospital Summary reports sputum culture showed \\'rare staph aureus\\' but specifies vancomycin was added due to MRSA nares positivity. 3. Sputum culture in summary does not confirm MRSA, conflicting with the fact\\'s assertion of MRSA in sputum.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by discharge.\\' 2. Hospital Summary reports sputum culture identified \\'rare staph aureus\\' (a Gram positive coccus), which constitutes completed speciation. 3. This directly contradicts the claim that speciation was not completed at discharge. 4. No mention of aspiration event in summary, but does not conflict as absence ≠ contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states patient is on Zosyn at discharge with pending sensitivities, while the fact states patient is finishing a 7 day course of Cipro 2. Summary indicates Klebsiella pneumoniae infection treated with Zosyn, while fact mentions Cipro treatment 3. Summary does not mention finasteride initiation that is stated in the fact 4. These treatment details directly contradict each other as they represent different antibiotic choices and treatment plans\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient was discharged with plans to continue Zosyn as an outpatient with pending sensitivities, whereas the Important Fact states the patient was finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge. These statements are contradictory because they mention different antibiotics (Zosyn vs. cipro) being used at discharge. Additionally, the Important Fact mentions starting finasteride to prevent future UTIs, which is not mentioned in the Hospital Course Summary. However, the primary contradiction lies in the antibiotic used at discharge.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states patient was \\'finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge\\' and \\'started on finasteride\\'. 2. Hospital Summary specifies discharge plan was to \\'Continue Zosyn as outpatient\\' (no mention of cipro) and contains no reference to finasteride initiation. 3. These medication discrepancies represent direct therapeutic contradictions.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 10, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** The patient with polysubstance use disorder (alcohol, meth) was admitted to the hospital due to concerns for acute alcohol withdrawal and received inpatient treatment for alcohol use disorder as well as linkages to outpatient MAT treatment. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the patient received \\'linkages to outpatient MAT treatment.\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary\\'s discharge plan under Problem #1 mentions \\'outpatient follow up with addiction medicine\\' but does not specify MAT (medication assisted treatment), which is a specific pharmacological intervention. 3. MAT is a distinct component of addiction treatment, and its absence in the summary\\'s documentation creates a direct conflict with the stated fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 12, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient sent to the hospital from home for symptoms of tachycardia, hypotension, found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula\\n\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was admitted due to hypotension and tachycardia suspected from a new gallbladder enteric fistula. However, under Problem #2: Gallbladder Enteric Fistula, it is stated that \\'No definitive fistula was detected\\' on CT imaging, although pneumobilia was initially present. This indicates a contradiction because the summary initially suggests the presence of a new gallbladder enteric fistula, while later it clarifies that no definitive fistula was detected on imaging.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states the gallbladder enteric fistula was \\'found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula.\\' 2. Hospital Summary under Problem #2 explicitly states \\'No definitive fistula was detected\\' in CT imaging, though pneumobilia was noted. 3. The absence of definitive fistula visualization in imaging directly conflicts with the assertion that it was confirmed (\\'found\\').\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary indicates blood glucose was elevated and required management with insulin sliding scale during the hospital stay 2. Under Problem #3, it specifically notes \\'hyperglycemia being managed\\' 3. These findings directly contradict the fact stating that DM2 was not worsened perioperatively 4. The need for ongoing glucose management with \\'moderate sliding scale insulin\\' suggests perioperative worsening of diabetes control\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions that the patient had \\'blood glucose elevated\\' and was managed with a \\'moderate sliding scale insulin regimen\\', indicating that her Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM2) was being actively managed perioperatively due to hyperglycemia. This contradicts the Important Fact that states \\'It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\' because the summary implies that DM2 was affected as evidenced by the need for insulin management.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states DM2 was not worsened perioperatively. 2. The Hospital Summary notes \\'blood glucose elevated\\' and \\'hyperglycemia being managed\\' under Problem #3. 3. Elevated glucose and active management (sliding scale insulin) indicate perioperative exacerbation of DM2. 4. This directly conflicts with the Important Fact\\'s assertion.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The hospital course summary details AKI secondary to nausea/vomiting as the main diagnosis, with problems focusing on: Nausea/vomiting Acute kidney injury Hypotension Heart failure Diabetes 2. Nowhere in the summary is viral gastroenteritis mentioned as a diagnosis or cause 3. The nausea/vomiting is described in context of causing AKI, but no viral etiology is specified 4. The summary attributes the patient\\'s condition to pre renal causes and possible ATN, not a viral infection\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the principal diagnosis at discharge was viral gastroenteritis. 2. The Hospital Course Summary attributes AKI to nausea/vomiting but never identifies viral gastroenteritis as the underlying cause. 3. All problem summaries (e.g., Problem #1: Nausea/Vomiting) describe management and resolution of symptoms without mentioning viral etiology. 4. Discharge plans focus on renal monitoring and symptom management, not infectious causes. 5. The absence of any reference to viral testing, infection control measures, or antiviral treatment contradicts the stated principal diagnosis.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 15, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily stopped when the patient initially came to the hospital.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, prednisone) were stopped. 2. Summary (Problem #2 AKI) explicitly mentions \\'held tacrolimus and mycophenolate\\' but does not mention stopping prednisone. 3. Since prednisone discontinuation is part of the Important Fact but not documented in the summary, this creates a direct contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 17, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Delirium tremens requiring intravenous benzodiazepines and phenobarbital for symptom control\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'delirium tremens\\' requiring IV benzodiazepines and phenobarbital. 2. The summary documents \\'acute alcohol withdrawal with hallucinations and tremors\\' treated with phenobarbital and ativan (a benzodiazepine), but never explicitly diagnoses delirium tremens. 3. Delirium tremens is a specific, severe form of alcohol withdrawal characterized by autonomic hyperactivity and altered mental status beyond perceptual disturbances. 4. The summary\\'s omission of this diagnosis while describing treatment appropriate for less severe withdrawal (CIWA protocol) creates a conflict, as both cannot simultaneously be true.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states the patient had non neutropenic fever with negative infectious workup (blood cultures NGTD, CXR and CT Abdomen showed no infectious focus) 2. The fact mentions \\'suspected pulmonary infection\\' but the summary\\'s imaging specifically showed no infectious focus on CXR 3. While both mention fever and negative workup, the summary indicates the fever resolved (patient was \\'afebrile 24 hours prior to discharge\\') rather than being persistent 4. The summary attributes the fever to suspected increased tumor burden, not to a pulmonary infection\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was admitted for non neutropenic fever and treated with broad spectrum antibiotics due to suspicion of increased tumor burden. The infectious workup revealed no significant findings (e.g., \\'Blood cultures: NGTD\\', \\'CXR and CT Abdomen: No infectious focus\\'). The patient became afebrile 24 hours prior to discharge. The Important Fact states \\'Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\'. The summary does not mention a pulmonary infection or persistent fever at discharge, as it states the patient was \\'Afebrile 24 hours prior to discharge\\'. Therefore, the summary contradicts the fact because it indicates the fever resolved, whereas the fact implies ongoing fever.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups.\\' 2. Summary under Problem #2 notes \\'afebrile 24 hours prior to discharge\\' and \\'CXR and CT Abdomen: No infectious focus,\\' indicating resolved fever and no evidence of pulmonary infection. 3. Antibiotics were administered due to tumor burden suspicion, not confirmed infection. 4. The summary explicitly contradicts the \\'persistent fever\\' and \\'suspected pulmonary infection\\' in the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 18, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma recently complicated by progression to CNS lymphoma\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)\\' with CNS progression. 2. The Hospital Summary specifies \\'high grade B cell lymphoma with MYC/BCL2 translocations\\' and \\'CNS lymphoma\\' in its medical history and Problem #5. 3. High grade B cell lymphoma with MYC/BCL2 rearrangements is a distinct entity from DLBCL per WHO classification, making these diagnoses mutually exclusive. 4. The summary\\'s lymphoma subtype directly conflicts with the DLBCL mentioned in the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 18, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The Important Fact states that AKI with hypokalemia resolved during admission 2. The summary shows: AKI did resolve (Creatinine went from 0.80 to 0.52) However, hypokalemia remained unresolved at discharge (potassium levels consistently low at 3.3 3.4) 3. Since the hypokalemia was still present and being treated at discharge (requiring ongoing potassium supplementation and monitoring), this contradicts the fact stating both conditions resolved\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that the patient experienced acute kidney injury, which resolved with fluid resuscitation, and hypokalemia, which was responsive to potassium supplementation. However, the potassium levels were \\'consistently low (3.3 3.4)\\' at discharge, indicating that hypokalemia was not fully resolved. The Important Fact states that \\'Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission.\\' Since the summary indicates that hypokalemia was not resolved, this contradicts the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states both AKI and hypokalemia resolved. 2. Summary\\'s Problem #3 confirms AKI resolved (creatinine 0.80→0.52, \\'Resolved AKI\\'). 3. Summary\\'s Problem #4 shows hypokalemia was \\'responsive to treatment\\' with ongoing supplementation and discharge plan for electrolyte monitoring, but doesn\\'t state resolution. 4. Persistent hypokalemia management at discharge contradicts the claim that hypokalemia resolved.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 19, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis).\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions only E. faecalis in urine cultures, while the fact states there were three organisms (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and E. faecalis) 2. While the summary mentions \\'past ESBL producing organisms,\\' it does not confirm current ESBL E. coli or Klebsiella infection 3. The summary indicates a single organism (E. faecalis) was found in current cultures, which contradicts the fact stating all three organisms were present 4. The summary does not mention hydronephrosis, though it notes a filling defect in left renal pole\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 20, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** HHT with new PE/DVT s/p IVC filter placement as well as changed to fondaparinux\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states anticoagulation was changed to fondaparinux. 2. Hospital summary documents initial transition from heparin to fondaparinux, but later states \\'switched to apixaban\\' in Problem #1 therapeutic procedures. 3. Discharge plan specifies continuing apixaban, not fondaparinux. This creates direct contradiction in anticoagulation regimen.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\'. 2. Hospital course shows thrombocytopenia was treated with prednisone 40 mg initially, then increased to 100 mg daily (not a taper). 3. Summary explicitly states \\'platelet count improved\\' with this regimen and discharge plan is to continue 100 mg daily. 4. \\'Taper initiation\\' implies dose reduction, but summary shows dose escalation and maintenance. 5. Both worsening thrombocytopenia and prednisone taper cannot coexist with documented platelet improvement and dose increase.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient.\\' 2. The Hospital Course explicitly notes telemetry revealed \\'runs of nonsustained SVT\\' during the fall evaluation (Problem #1). 3. SVT is a documented potential cardiac cause of falls, contradicting the claim that the etiology remains unknown after workup.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states \\'CT showed a new T6 compression deformity\\' under Problem #2 2. The summary describes this injury as resulting from the current admission\\'s fall (\\'admitted following a fall resulting in a T6 compression fracture\\') 3. This directly contradicts the Important Fact stating the fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall\\' 4. The temporal relationship between the fracture and fall is clearly different between the two sources\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that Mrs. Mallonee was admitted following a fall resulting in a T6 compression fracture and that CT showed a new T6 compression deformity. This indicates that the T6 compression fracture occurred during the recent fall. The Important Fact states that the T6 wedge compression fracture likely happened before the most recent fall. These two statements are contradictory because the summary suggests the fracture was new and happened during the fall, while the fact suggests it happened before the fall.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the T6 fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall.\\' 2. The Hospital Summary states under Problem #2: \\'CT showed a new T6 compression deformity\\' and describes it as resulting from \\'a fall\\' (singular) that caused admission. 3. The term \\'new\\' in imaging implies acute/recent injury, directly linking it to the index fall event that prompted hospitalization. This contradicts the Important Fact\\'s assertion of a pre existing fracture.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 22, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange.\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary attributes cholangitis to a \\'biliary drain exchange\\' (Brief Description) and \\'drain exchange\\' (Problem #1), with no mention of a stent. 3. Biliary drain exchanges (external percutaneous drains) and stent exchanges (internal biliary stents) are distinct procedures. 4. The summary explicitly links cholangitis to a drain exchange, conflicting with the stent exchange in the fact, making both statements incompatible.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact specifies \\'augmentin therapy\\' needing re evaluation before 14 day completion. 2. The Hospital Course Summary states the patient was treated with intravenous Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam), not Augmentin. 3. Continuing Zosyn instead of Augmentin directly conflicts with the fact, as they are different antibiotics. 4. No mention of Augmentin in the summary implies a contradiction with the fact\\'s specified therapy.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 22, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** patient should follow up with Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/ Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Poultsides, George, MD in in 2 weeks\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact specifies follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider (APP) in 1 week and Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. 2. The Hospital Course Summary\\'s \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' and discharge plans mention follow ups with SLP, Nutrition Cancer Center, oncology, and endocrine, but do not reference APP or Dr. Poultsides. 3. The absence of these specific follow up appointments in the summary creates a direct contradiction with the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 23, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** large pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'large pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis\\' (status post procedure). 2. The Hospital Course Summary explicitly documents \\'large right pleural effusion noted on imaging\\' (pre procedure) and \\'thoracentesis performed with removal of 1.75L serosanguinous fluid\\' followed by \\'significant improvement post thoracentesis\\'. 3. These records confirm the pleural effusion was addressed through thoracentesis with clinical improvement, making the post procedural \\'large\\' designation in the Important Fact contradictory to the documented outcome.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 23, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact mentions \\'progressing CLL\\', but the Hospital Course Summary states under Problem #1: \\'Current Clinical Status: Disease is stable\\'. 2. The summary explicitly describes CLL as stable (not progressing) and confirms continuation of existing management. 3. Mitral valvulopathy is addressed as \\'Mitral Valve Stenosis\\' in the summary (gradient of 25 on TTE), which aligns with the fact. The contradiction specifically applies to CLL progression status.\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 23, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states Cardiology will coordinate with the Heart Failure team regarding a transcatheter MVR and clinical trial drug (4/2023). 2. The Hospital Summary\\'s cardiology follow up plan (under Problem #2) mentions \\'comprehensive valve disease management\\' and scheduled trans thoracic echocardiogram, but no reference to: Heart Failure team collaboration Transcatheter MVR Clinical trial drug involvement 3. The only medication mentioned in discharge plans is Duvelisib (CLL treatment), unrelated to heart failure trials. 4. This creates a direct contradiction as the specific interventions/coordination in the fact are absent in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 26, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Metoprolol dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily for improved rate control; Apixaban dosage increased to 5 mg twice daily for anticoagulation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states metoprolol was increased to 75 mg twice daily and apixaban to 5 mg twice daily. 2. The Hospital Course Summary mentions \\'rate control with diltiazem and metoprolol\\' but does not specify any dosage increase for metoprolol. 3. Apixaban (an anticoagulant) is not mentioned at all in the entire summary, despite being part of the Important Fact. 4. Both the absence of apixaban documentation and lack of metoprolol dosage specification create contradictions with the stated fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**34. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions CT showing SMA narrowing but explicitly states it \\'ruled out acute ischemia\\' 2. The summary attributes the patient\\'s symptoms primarily to gastroparesis, not chronic mesenteric ischemia 3. While both documents mention SMA findings, they differ in their clinical interpretation the Important Fact suggests mesenteric ischemia as the cause while the summary rules it out 4. This represents a direct contradiction in the clinical interpretation of the patient\\'s condition\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states that emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia due to SMA stenosis. 2. The Hospital Summary under Problem #1 explicitly notes \\'CT showed SMA narrowing but ruled out acute ischemia\\' and attributes symptoms to gastroparesis/dyspepsia. 3. While SMA stenosis is confirmed, the summary does not mention chronic mesenteric ischemia as a potential contributor to emesis, instead resolving symptoms with gastroparesis focused care. 4. The absence of acknowledgment of chronic ischemia as a possible etiology (despite SMA findings) creates a conflict with the Important Fact\\'s assertion of a potential relationship.\\n\\n\\n\\n**35. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states bacteremia was due to coagulase negative strep. 2. Hospital Summary (Problem #1) reports blood cultures showed Coagulase Negative Staphylococci bacteremia. 3. Staphylococci and Streptococci are distinct bacterial groups; coagulase negative strep does not exist. 4. This constitutes a direct microbiological contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**36. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact mentions sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, but the summary does not mention sepsis or antibiotic use. 2. The summary confirms delirium managed with pharmacotherapy, aligning with the fact. 3. The Important Fact states urinary retention requiring a catheter, which is absent in the summary. Since two of three key complications (sepsis, urinary retention) are unmentioned, the summary conflicts with the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**37. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary describes active management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with specific plans: PET/CT scheduled for evaluation of cervical nodal disease Explicit mention of \\'Consider chemotherapy plan based on patient and family decision\\' Coordination for outpatient oncological follow up 2. While delirium is mentioned as a problem that improved with treatment, there\\'s no indication that cancer management was deferred because of it 3. The summary shows ongoing cancer management decisions and planning, contradicting the fact that management was deferred\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that there was a \\'coordination for outpatient oncological follow up\\' and \\'consider chemotherapy plan based on patient and family decision\\', which implies that the management of the patient\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was not entirely deferred to the outpatient oncologist. Instead, there were ongoing plans and considerations during the hospital stay. This contradicts the Important Fact that management was deferred to the outpatient oncologist per the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n\\n\\n**38. Patient 29, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states O2 requirement was due to aspiration pneumonitis. 2. Hospital Summary (Problem #4) attributes respiratory issues to \\'aspiration related atelectasis\\' (CXR showed no consolidation) and notes \\'maintaining oxygen requirements\\' without mentioning pneumonitis. 3. Pneumonitis (inflammatory) and atelectasis (mechanical) are distinct etiologies. 4. This creates a diagnostic contradiction regarding the cause of O2 requirement.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'phi-3-5-mini-instruct': '# Factual evaluation of the phi-3-5-mini-instruct summarizer by a LLM jury\\n\\n## Jury members: claude-3.5-sonnet-v2, llama4-maverick, deepseek-r1\\n\\n## Main results\\n\\n### A. Presence of important facts\\n\\n**Score: 38/100** (95% CI: 28-48) (higher values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the important facts missing:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries frequently omit critical clinical details through recurring patterns: **procedural/treatment omissions** (Patient 0’s left JP drain, Patient 1’s chest tube removal), **incomplete medication documentation** (Patient 6’s absent DVT prophylaxis, Patient 20’s missing prednisone taper), and **unstated causal relationships** (Patient 2’s nausea/vomiting not linked to necrotic mass, Patient 3’s chest pain unattributed to thrombus). **Diagnostic ambiguities** arise from missing specifics (Patient 4’s pancreatic tail location, Patient 15’s absent creatinine values) and **implied-but-unstated standards** (DVT prophylaxis in Patient 0, PJP prophylaxis in Patient 16). **Follow-up/timeline gaps** (Patient 12’s unspecified TPN follow-up frequency, Patient 22’s omitted provider appointments) and **partial documentation** (Patient 9’s Cipro course replaced with Zosyn, Patient 25’s unreported EGD/ERCP plans) further contribute. **Terminology mismatches** (Patient 6’s Levemir vs. Lantus, Patient 23’s “mitral stenosis” vs. “valvulopathy”) and **absent symptom-etiology links** (Patient 28’s hyperbilirubinemia unattributed to failed PTBD) exemplify how implicit clinical reasoning often fails to translate into explicit documentation. These patterns reflect systemic prioritization of acute management over granular detail, particularly for chronic conditions, procedural sequalae, and inferred clinical logic.\\n\\n### B. Hospital course summaries contradicting important facts\\n\\n**Score: 25/100** (95% CI: 16-35) (lower values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the inconsistencies:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries frequently exhibit inconsistencies with key clinical facts due to recurring patterns of documentation errors. Common failure modes include **medication discrepancies** (Patient 6: Levemir 16U BID vs. Lantus 15U BID; Patient 26: apixaban dosage reduced vs. increased), **conflicting diagnoses** (Patient 15: AKI/ESRD vs. viral gastroenteritis as principal diagnosis; Patient 27: coagulase-negative strep vs. staphylococcal bacteremia), and **omission of critical details** (Patient 9: Cipro discharge plan vs. Zosyn use; Patient 16: missing Bactrim documentation). **Contradictory clinical assessments** arise in postoperative courses (Patient 13: \"unremarkable\" vs. documented diabetes/hypertension complications) and etiology attributions (Patient 21: \"unknown\" falls vs. gait instability; Patient 22: cholangitis cause pre- vs. post-procedure). **Procedural/timing mismatches** (Patient 24: prior SBO surgeries vs. \"nonoperative\" claim; Patient 21: T6 fracture timeline) and **care plan inconsistencies** (Patient 23: omitted clinical trial referral; Patient 29: deferred vs. active cancer management) further highlight documentation gaps. These errors often stem from incomplete data synthesis, terminology confusion (e.g., insulin types), or failure to reconcile evolving clinical narratives.\\n\\n## Detailed results\\n\\n### A.

All Missing Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 0, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left-sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the entire hospital course summary, including both the standard section based and problem based summaries, as well as the detailed conclusion. While the summary includes comprehensive information about the patient\\'s Whipple procedure, postoperative care, and discharge conditions, there is no explicit mention of a left sided abdominal JP drain or any drain being present at discharge. The discharge section discusses pain management, diet advancement, and general recovery status, but does not mention any drains. Even in the postoperative care details and discharge planning sections, there is no reference to drain management or presence. Therefore, while the patient may have had drains placed during surgery (as is common with Whipple procedures), the specific fact about a left sided abdominal JP drain being present at discharge is not explicitly mentioned in this summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary is thoroughly reviewed to determine if the fact \\'Left sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary is divided into sections including reason for admission, relevant medical and surgical history, primary and secondary diagnoses, key diagnostic investigations, therapeutic procedures performed, medications, and patient\\'s condition at discharge. It also includes a problem based summary. Upon examining each section, there is no explicit mention of a \\'Left sided abdominal JP drain\\' or its status at discharge. The summary discusses the patient\\'s recovery post Whipple procedure, pain management, dietary advancement, and monitoring for complications but does not specify the presence or absence of a JP drain.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1. Searched all sections of the hospital course summary including \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\', \\'Medications\\', \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge\\', and discharge plans across both standard and problem based summaries. 2. No mention of any surgical drain (JP drain or equivalent terms like \\'Jackson Pratt\\', \\'abdominal drain\\', or \\'drain placement\\') is found in any context. 3. While the Whipple procedure often involves drain placement, the summary explicitly lists only the procedure itself without describing postoperative drain management. 4. The discharge documentation focuses on pain control, diet, and lab monitoring but contains no references to drain care or presence of drains at discharge. 5. No abbreviations or clinical synonyms for left sided abdominal drains are present in the text. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 0, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Discharged with DVT prophylaxis, with anemia at hemoglobin 8.8\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I will analyze whether the fact \\'Discharged with DVT prophylaxis, with anemia at hemoglobin 8.8\\' is explicitly mentioned: 1. Regarding hemoglobin 8.8: This is explicitly mentioned multiple times in the summary Under \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\': \\'Blood work indicated anemia with hemoglobin levels of 8.8 g/dL\\' Under Problem #3: \\'Hemoglobin improved to 8.8 g/dL postoperatively\\' 2. Regarding DVT prophylaxis: After carefully reviewing the entire summary, including medications, discharge plans, and postoperative care There is no explicit mention of DVT prophylaxis being prescribed at discharge While DVT prophylaxis would be standard of care after a Whipple procedure, we cannot assume it was given without explicit documentation Therefore, while the hemoglobin of 8.8 is clearly documented, the DVT prophylaxis component is not mentioned. Since both components must be present to consider the fact fully mentioned, this results in a 0.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient was discharged with a hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, indicating anemia. However, it does not directly state that the patient was discharged with DVT prophylaxis. The summary lists medications and treatments but does not mention DVT prophylaxis specifically. Therefore, the fact \\'Discharged with DVT prophylaxis, with anemia at hemoglobin 8.8\\' is not entirely mentioned because DVT prophylaxis is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions anemia with hemoglobin 8.8 g/dL in both the \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\' section and Problem #3 (Anemia). However, there is no mention of DVT prophylaxis in any section of the summary, including discharge medications, discharge plans, or therapeutic procedures. While the anemia component of the fact is clearly documented, the DVT prophylaxis component is entirely absent from the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 1, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypoxia 2/2 recurrent R pleura effusion\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary step by step to look for explicit mention of hypoxia due to right pleural effusion: 1. In Format 1, Section 1 \\'Reason for Admission\\' states \\'severe shortness of breath and hypoxia, primarily caused by recurrent pleural effusion\\' 2. Multiple mentions of pleural effusion appear throughout the summary, with confirmation via imaging showing \\'loculated pleural effusion\\' 3. However, while the summary clearly links hypoxia to pleural effusion, it does not specifically identify the effusion as being on the right side (R pleural effusion) 4. The location (right vs. left) of the pleural effusion is never explicitly stated in any section of the summary 5. While the causal relationship between hypoxia and pleural effusion is clearly established, the specific anatomical location (right sided) that we\\'re looking for is missing\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 1, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** R chest tube was placed with drainage; intrapleural alteplase given; chest tube removed\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step: 1. In Format 1, Section 7 \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' mentions: \\'A chest tube was placed for pleural effusion management\\' \\'Alteplase was administered to improve drainage\\' 2. The location of the chest tube (R chest) is not explicitly specified. 3. The chest tube removal is not explicitly mentioned in the summary. 4. The summary confirms two of the three required elements: Chest tube placement Intrapleural alteplase administration However, since the right sided location and the removal of the chest tube are not explicitly mentioned, we cannot consider this fact as completely present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that a chest tube was placed for pleural effusion management and alteplase was administered to improve drainage. However, it does not explicitly state that the chest tube was removed. The relevant information is found in \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' under Format 1 and \\'Problem #5: Pericardial Effusion\\' under Format 2, which indicate chest tube placement and alteplase administration. The fact that the chest tube was placed and alteplase was given is mentioned, but the removal of the chest tube is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly mentions \\'chest tube placement for pleural effusion\\' and \\'alteplase administration\\' under therapeutic procedures. 2. The fact specifies \\'R chest tube\\' but the summary does not mention the side (right), though this is a minor wording gap. 3. The critical missing element is chest tube removal, which is not stated anywhere in the summary. 4. While placement and alteplase are present, removal is a key component of the fact that\\'s absent. 5. Since all three components (placement, alteplase, removal) are required for the full fact, the removal\\'s absence leads to 0.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 2, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Nausea/vomiting 2/2 small bowel necrotic mass\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact about nausea/vomiting due to small bowel necrotic mass is partially but not fully explicitly mentioned in the summary. While the summary mentions both: 1. Nausea and vomiting (in multiple places, including \\'presented with worsening nausea and vomiting\\' and \\'chronic nausea/vomiting\\') 2. A small bowel mass (described as \\'necrotic small bowel mass\\' in Problem #3) However, the summary does not explicitly state that the nausea/vomiting was caused by (\\'2/2\\') the necrotic mass. While this connection might be clinically inferred, the causal relationship is not directly stated in the text. The nausea/vomiting is mentioned in context of nutritional risk and as a presenting symptom, but the direct causation from the mass is not explicitly documented.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions both components of the fact but does not directly link them as cause and effect. The \\'Reason for Admission\\' states the patient presented with \\'worsening nausea and vomiting\\' and had a \\'new small bowel mass\\'. The term \\'necrotic small bowel mass\\' appears in the Problem Based Summary (Problem #3) and Conclusion sections. While nausea/vomiting and the necrotic mass are both documented, the summary does not explicitly state that the nausea/vomiting was secondary to (2/2) the necrotic mass. The symptoms and mass are presented as concurrent findings rather than establishing a direct causal relationship per the specific phrasing required by the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 2, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed. Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that while a laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis is mentioned in the \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' section, the specific details about taking down adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall and removing obstructing necrotic mass are not explicitly stated. The summary mentions a \\'necrotic small bowel mass\\' in Problem #3 and discusses that surgical resection was performed, but does not provide the specific surgical details about adhesions or the technical aspects of removing the obstructing mass. While we can infer these steps might have occurred during the surgery, the exact surgical details requested are not explicitly documented in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'Laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' under Therapeutic Procedures Performed and refers to \\'successful resection of the necrotic small bowel mass\\' in the conclusion. However, there is no mention of adhesions between the omentum and abdominal wall being taken down. While the obstructing necrotic mass removal and small bowel resection are clearly documented, the adhesion takedown is absent. Since the fact requires both components (adhesion takedown and mass removal/resection), and one component is missing, the full fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 2, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient recovered from surgery well; had flatus and bowel movement \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of the patient having flatus or bowel movement post surgery. While the summary includes extensive details about the surgical procedure (laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis) and mentions medications for bowel preparation (Senna and miralax), it does not specifically state whether the patient had return of bowel function. The summary discusses the patient\\'s stability post surgery and improved nutritional status, but does not include this specific clinical milestone. Even in the sections discussing post operative status and Problem #3 (Necrotic Small Bowel Mass), there is no mention of bowel function recovery. This is a notable omission given that return of bowel function is typically an important post operative indicator.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s treatment and recovery process. Under \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed,\\' it is mentioned that the patient underwent \\'Laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis.\\' The summary further discusses the patient\\'s condition at discharge, stating that she is \\'stable with improved nutritional status post surgical intervention and nutritional therapy.\\' While it does not directly state \\'had flatus and bowel movement,\\' the document implies recovery from surgery. However, there is no explicit mention of the patient having flatus or a bowel movement, which are specific indicators of postoperative recovery, particularly regarding bowel function.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1. Searched all sections of the hospital course summary for explicit mentions of postoperative recovery markers (flatus/bowel movement) or direct statements about surgical recovery. 2. The \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge\\' section states \\'stable with improved nutritional status post surgical intervention\\' but does not mention bowel function. 3. The \\'Therapeutic Procedures\\' section documents bowel resection surgery but contains no postoperative recovery details. 4. Medications include bowel prep agents (Senna/Miralax) but these relate to preoperative preparation. 5. The Problem Based Summary for the bowel mass mentions \\'post resection\\' status but no functional recovery details. 6. While nutritional improvement is noted, bowel function milestones (flatus/BM) key indicators of postoperative GI recovery are never explicitly stated in any section. The summary describes surgical success and stability but omits specific bowel function documentation.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 3, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** LLQ abdominal pain 2/2 cancer\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital summary mentions \\'recurrent lower quadrant abdominal pain\\' in both the Reason for Admission and Secondary Diagnoses sections. 2. The primary diagnosis is metastatic sigmoid adenocarcinoma (a left sided colon cancer), which anatomically correlates with LLQ pain. 3. While the pain location is specified as \\'lower quadrant\\' rather than explicitly \\'LLQ,\\' and the etiology is implied through its listing alongside cancer related diagnoses, the exact phrase \\'LLQ abdominal pain 2/2 cancer\\' or an unequivocal statement of causation (e.g., \\'pain due to cancer\\') is absent. 4. A busy physician might infer the relationship given the context, but per guidelines requiring explicit mention (even via synonyms/abbreviations), this doesn\\'t meet the threshold for \\'1\\' as no direct attribution is made.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 3, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** R-sided chest pain 2/2 port-associated thrombus\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'right sided chest pain\\' as one of the reasons for admission and as a secondary diagnosis. It also mentions a \\'non occlusive thrombus around the right port catheter\\' as a secondary diagnosis and details the management with apixaban. The summary connects the presence of the thrombus to the initiation of anticoagulation therapy. While it does not directly state \\'R sided chest pain 2/2 port associated thrombus,\\' it provides enough information to infer that the right sided chest pain was associated with the presence of a thrombus around the port catheter. The fact that the chest pain was managed with a fentanyl patch and the thrombus was treated with apixaban is clearly documented. Therefore, the specific fact is implicitly supported by the information given in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly lists \\'Right sided chest pain\\' as a secondary diagnosis (Problem #2) and \\'non occlusive thrombus around the right port catheter\\' as Problem #4. 2. The thrombus is described in diagnostic findings and managed with apixaban. 3. However, the summary does not explicitly state a causal relationship (e.g., \\'due to\\' or \\'secondary to\\') between the right sided chest pain and the port associated thrombus. 4. While both elements are present, the text does not directly attribute the chest pain to the thrombus using clinical terminology like \\'2/2\\' or equivalent phrasing. 5. A busy physician would recognize both issues but would not find explicit causation documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 4, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pancreatic tail mass leading to outpatient GI biopsy\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that while a pancreatic mass is mentioned multiple times (specifically a 2 2.1 cm mass seen on CTAP and a 2.9 cm solid enhancement cystic mass with side branch enhancing nodule on MRI), there is no explicit mention of a GI biopsy being performed or scheduled as an outpatient procedure. The summary only indicates that the patient is \\'awaiting biopsy results\\' and has \\'expedited biopsy and oncology follow up\\' planned, but does not specify that this will be done as an outpatient GI procedure. The location (tail) of the pancreatic mass is also not specified in the summary. While further workup of the mass is clearly planned, the specific fact about a pancreatic tail mass leading to outpatient GI biopsy is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions a 2 cm pancreatic mass identified on CTAP as a 2.1 cm pancreatic mass and on MRI Abdomen as a 2.9 cm solid enhancement cystic mass. The summary also indicates that the patient is awaiting further investigation, including a biopsy and oncology follow up for the pancreatic mass. However, it does not explicitly state that the pancreatic mass is located in the tail or that a GI biopsy was performed as an outpatient. The summary does mention that a biopsy is pending, but it does not specify whether it is an inpatient or outpatient procedure. Therefore, the specific fact \\'Pancreatic tail mass leading to outpatient GI biopsy\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly mentions a 2 cm pancreatic mass requiring oncology evaluation and an \\'expedited biopsy\\' in the discharge plan. 2. While the summary specifies that a biopsy is pending, it does not explicitly state the anatomical location of the mass as the pancreatic tail. 3. The term \\'outpatient GI biopsy\\' is not directly used, though the context of \\'expedited biopsy\\' in the discharge plan strongly implies an outpatient procedure. 4. The absence of explicit localization to the pancreatic tail and the lack of direct phrasing \\'outpatient GI biopsy\\' mean the fact is not fully stated verbatim or through unambiguous clinical synonyms. 5. A busy physician might infer these details, but per guidelines requiring explicit mention, this qualifies as 0.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 4, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Gout that was treated with prednisone taper\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact about gout being treated with prednisone taper is partially mentioned in the summary. The summary explicitly states that prednisone was initiated/started for gout management in multiple sections: 1. In the \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' section: \\'Prednisone initiated for gout management\\' 2. In the \\'Medications\\' section: \\'Prednisone started for gout\\' 3. In the \\'Gout\\' problem section: \\'Active gout managed with prednisone\\' However, while prednisone treatment for gout is clearly documented, the specific detail about it being a \\'taper\\' is not explicitly mentioned anywhere in the summary. Despite this missing detail about the taper, the core fact that gout was treated with prednisone is clearly present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient had \\'active gout\\' and that \\'prednisone was initiated for gout management.\\' Under the \\'Gout\\' section in the Problem Based Summary, it is stated that \\'Active gout managed with prednisone.\\' This indicates that gout was treated with prednisone. Although the summary does not explicitly mention a \\'prednisone taper,\\' it does imply ongoing management with prednisone, suggesting that the treatment was not necessarily a one time dose but an ongoing regimen that could reasonably include a taper, especially given the context of managing gout. However, the explicit mention of a \\'taper\\' is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 5, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Increased bloody output from JP drain observed on POD1, gradually improved\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary for any mention of JP drain output or bloody drainage on POD1. The analysis involved: 1) Checking the postoperative period descriptions in both the standard and problem based summaries, 2) Looking for any mentions of drains or drainage in the surgical procedure section and postoperative course, 3) Reviewing the \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge\\' and complications sections. While the summary includes detailed information about the surgery and postoperative status, including pain control and general recovery, there is no explicit mention of JP drain output or any description of bloody drainage on POD1 or its subsequent improvement. The closest related information only describes that the patient was \\'stable postoperatively\\' without any specific drain related details.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was thoroughly reviewed to determine if it explicitly mentions \\'Increased bloody output from JP drain observed on POD1, gradually improved.\\' The summary is structured into sections including reason for admission, relevant medical history, surgical history, diagnoses, diagnostic investigations, therapeutic procedures, medications, and patient\\'s condition at discharge. It also includes a problem based summary and conclusion. Upon examining each section, there is no explicit mention of the JP drain output or its characteristics postoperatively. The summary focuses on the patient\\'s stable postoperative condition, pain management, and absence of nausea or vomiting but does not detail the JP drain\\'s output.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed section by section. The key sections reviewed include \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed,\\' \\'Medications,\\' \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge,\\' and the Problem Based Summary. There is no explicit mention of a JP drain (Jackson Pratt drain) or any description of its output (e.g., bloody drainage, volume changes, or trends over time). While postoperative monitoring is mentioned (e.g., hemoglobin/hematocrit checks), the specific observation of increased bloody output on POD1 followed by gradual improvement is absent. The summary focuses on pain control, ambulation, and stable recovery but does not address drain output details.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step: 1. The summary mentions the patient has primary adrenal insufficiency and autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS Type 2), which matches part of the fact. 2. The summary confirms the patient experienced an adrenal crisis, as stated in both the Reason for Admission and Primary Diagnosis sections. 3. However, while the summary mentions the patient was on oral prednisone (2.5 mg twice daily), it does not explicitly state that the adrenal crisis was due to intolerance of PO prednisone. 4. The summary suggests a possible malabsorption syndrome is being investigated, but does not explicitly link this to prednisone intolerance or state it as the cause of the adrenal crisis. 5. While many elements of the fact are present (adrenal crisis, primary adrenal insufficiency, APS), the specific causation related to PO prednisone intolerance is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient had an adrenal crisis secondary to primary adrenal insufficiency in the context of Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2 (APS Type 2). However, while the summary mentions the patient was on oral prednisone (2.5 mg twice daily) and required IV hydrocortisone for stabilization, it does not explicitly state that the adrenal crisis was due to \\'intolerance of PO prednisone.\\' The text describes malabsorption syndrome as a suspected/ongoing issue but does not directly link prednisone intolerance to the crisis. The transition to IV steroids appears to be part of crisis management rather than documented intolerance.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step for the specific fact about Type 1 diabetes and insulin change to Lantus 15 units twice daily: 1. Type 1 diabetes is explicitly mentioned multiple times in the text (as T1DM) 2. The summary mentions insulin changes in several places: \\'insulin drip for glucose control\\' \\'transitioned from IV insulin to subcutaneous insulin\\' \\'Adjusted insulin regimen from 5 units/hr to 16 units BID (Levemir)\\' 3. While insulin changes are documented, the specific change to Lantus 15 units twice daily is NOT mentioned. Instead, the text indicates a change to Levemir 16 units BID. 4. This is a different insulin type (Levemir vs Lantus) and different dosage (16 units vs 15 units) than what we\\'re looking for.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient was transitioned from IV insulin to subcutaneous insulin. Specifically, it states that the insulin regimen was adjusted from 5 units/hr to 16 units BID (Levemir). However, it does not mention \\'Lantus\\' or the specific dosage \\'15units twice a day\\'. Lantus and Levemir are both long acting insulin analogs, but they are not the same; Lantus is insulin glargine, and Levemir is insulin detemir. Therefore, the exact fact \\'insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions the patient has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and describes insulin adjustments. Under \\'Medications\\' in the Section Based Summary, it states: \\'Adjusted insulin regimen from 5 units/hr to 16 units BID (Levemir)\\'. While this confirms an insulin regimen change to a basal insulin (Levemir) at 16 units twice daily, the specific fact in question refers to Lantus (a different basal insulin) at 15 units twice daily. The summary does not mention Lantus or a 15 unit dose, and Levemir is a distinct product. The dosage discrepancy (16 vs. 15 units) and insulin type difference (Levemir vs. Lantus) mean the exact fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 6, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Vitamin D deficiency, started on replacement, fat soluble vitamins sent, need to follow-up \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I searched for any mention of vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D replacement therapy, fat soluble vitamin testing, or related follow up instructions. Here\\'s my step by step analysis: 1. Reviewed the initial diagnoses and medical history no mention of vitamin D deficiency 2. Checked the diagnostic investigations section while many lab values are listed, vitamin D levels are not mentioned 3. Examined the therapeutic procedures and medications sections no vitamin D supplementation is listed 4. Reviewed the problem based summary no vitamin D related issues are listed among the problems 5. Checked the discharge plans and follow up instructions while there are multiple follow ups mentioned (endocrinology, psychiatry), none specifically relate to vitamin D or fat soluble vitamin monitoring 6. While malabsorption syndrome is mentioned as a concern requiring further evaluation, there is no explicit mention of vitamin D deficiency or fat soluble vitamin testing as part of this workup\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, medical history, and treatment. To determine if the fact \\'Vitamin D deficiency, started on replacement, fat soluble vitamins sent, need to follow up\\' is mentioned, we need to look for any reference to Vitamin D deficiency, its treatment, or related tests. Upon reviewing the summary, there is no explicit mention of Vitamin D deficiency, initiation of Vitamin D replacement, or the sending of fat soluble vitamins for testing. The summary does discuss the patient\\'s complex medical conditions and various diagnostic tests, but none directly relate to Vitamin D or fat soluble vitamins.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed in detail. The key points checked were: 1) Vitamin D deficiency not mentioned in diagnoses, lab results (B12 is mentioned but not Vitamin D), or problem lists. 2) Replacement started medications listed include B12 supplementation but no Vitamin D replacement. 3) Fat soluble vitamins sent while malabsorption is suspected and a malabsorption panel was pending, there\\'s no explicit mention of fat soluble vitamin supplementation. 4) Follow up need follow up for endocrinology and malabsorption is mentioned, but not specifically for Vitamin D. None of the four components of the fact are explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 7, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second-line\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the entire hospital course summary, searching for any mention of a hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo (ipilimumab/nivolumab) and subsequent switch to cabozantinib. My analysis followed these steps: 1. Checked all medication sections and treatment discussions 2. Reviewed the oncology related content, including the sections about RCC treatment 3. Examined both the standard section based summary and problem based summary 4. Looked for any mentions of immunotherapy or targeted therapy 5. Searched for terms related to drug reactions or therapy changes The only cancer treatment mentioned is neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with no specific details about the type. There is no mention of: Ipilimumab/nivolumab (or ipi/nivo) Any hypersensitivity reaction Cabozantinib Any switch in cancer therapy Therefore, this specific fact is not explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention a hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo (ipilimumab/nivolumab) or a switch to cabozantinib as a second line treatment. The summary focuses on the patient\\'s admission for a left nephrectomy with tumor thrombectomy due to renal cell carcinoma and the management of various comorbid conditions. It details the patient\\'s history, diagnosis, surgical procedure, postoperative care, and discharge plan but does not reference any immunotherapy with ipi/nivo or a subsequent switch to cabozantinib.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed in both standard and problem based formats. Key sections reviewed include Medications, Therapeutic Procedures, and Discharge Plans. There is no mention of ipilimumab (ipi) or nivolumab (nivo) at any point in the summary. The neoadjuvant therapy referenced in the \\'Reason for Admission\\' is unspecified, and no hypersensitivity reactions to medications are documented. Cabozantinib is not listed in medications, treatment plans, or problem lists. The absence of these specific agents or any clear synonyms (e.g., \\'immunotherapy complications\\') confirms the fact is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the entire hospital course summary, including both the standard section based summary and problem based summary, searching for any mention of: 1) an aspiration event prior to discharge, 2) blood culture results showing 1/4 bottles positive for GPC (Gram positive cocci), and 3) incomplete speciation at discharge. None of these specific details are mentioned anywhere in the text. While the summary does discuss the patient\\'s pneumonia, antibiotic treatment (including Vancomycin for MRSA), and mentions that the patient has dysphagia managed with a G tube, it does not mention any aspiration events. Additionally, while various diagnostic tests are mentioned (including chest X ray and blood work), there is no specific mention of blood culture results showing 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, nor any reference to pending speciation results at discharge.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was thoroughly reviewed to determine if it explicitly mentioned a potential aspiration event prior to discharge and the results of blood cultures (1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge). Upon examining the summary, there was no mention of an aspiration event. Additionally, the summary did not report any blood culture results positive for Gram positive cocci (GPC) or indicate that speciation was pending at the time of discharge. The summary detailed the patient\\'s treatment for lobar pneumonia, management of various chronic conditions, and discharge plans, but it did not include the specific fact in question.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention a potential aspiration event prior to discharge, nor does it reference 1/4 bottles positive for GPC with incomplete speciation. While the patient has dysphagia (a risk factor for aspiration) and G tube feeding was stopped, no aspiration event is documented. The summary includes respiratory cultures (e.g., Vancomycin for MRSA nares/respiratory culture) but does not report GPC findings or pending speciation. The absence of these specific details meets the criteria for 0, as no equivalent phrasing exists in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 8, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Neurogenic bladder, high risk of UTI\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'neurogenic bladder\\' in multiple sections (Relevant Medical History, Secondary Diagnoses, and Problem #3). However, the specific phrase \\'high risk of UTI\\' is not directly stated. While neurogenic bladder and catheterization (mentioned as occurring five times daily) are well known risk factors for UTIs in clinical practice, the summary does not explicitly state \\'high risk of UTI\\' or an equivalent phrase. The guidelines specify that minor wording gaps or implied risks should not trigger a 0, but since the risk itself is not articulated (even as a consequence of the neurogenic bladder/catheterization), it does not meet the threshold for being explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, the specific fact about sepsis from urinary source with pyelonephritis and a 7 day course of cipro is only partially mentioned. Here\\'s the step by step analysis: 1. Sepsis from urinary source: YES The summary explicitly mentions \\'Sepsis (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome with suspected infection)\\' and confirms a \\'complicated urinary tract infection with Klebsiella species\\' 2. Pyelonephritis: YES The summary mentions \\'possible developing pyelonephritis\\' and CT Abdomen/Pelvis shows \\'signs of developing pyelonephritis\\' 3. 7 day course of cipro: NO While antibiotics are mentioned (specifically Zosyn/piperacillin tazobactam), there is no mention of Cipro or a 7 day course 4. Finasteride: YES The summary mentions \\'Initiation of finasteride 5 mg once daily for prostatomegaly\\' Since a key component (Cipro course) is missing, and the antibiotic mentioned is different (Zosyn), we cannot say this specific fact is fully present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, treatment, and discharge plan. The primary diagnosis was a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) with Klebsiella species, with possible developing pyelonephritis, as indicated by fever, confusion, and positive urine culture. The patient was diagnosed with sepsis (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome with suspected infection) and septic encephalopathy. The patient was treated with Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam) and finasteride was initiated for prostatomegaly. At discharge, the patient\\'s fever had resolved, but he continued to experience burning on urination. The discharge plan included continuing Zosyn and monitoring urine culture sensitivities. The fact to be verified is \\'Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs.\\' The summary explicitly mentions sepsis from a urinary source and possible pyelonephritis. It also mentions that finasteride was started. However, it does not mention \\'finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge.\\' Instead, it states that the patient was treated with Zosyn, not ciprofloxacin (Cipro), and was to continue Zosyn at discharge. Thus, the specific fact about completing a 7 day course of Cipro is not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis from urinary source is mentioned in the \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\' as \\'Sepsis (Systemicemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome with suspected infection)\\' with the primary diagnosis being a UTI caused by Klebsiella. 2. Potential pyelonephritis is explicitly stated in the \\'Primary Diagnosis\\' as \\'possible developing pyelonephritis\\'. 3. The summary specifies Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam) as the antibiotic used, with no mention of ciprofloxacin or a 7 day course completed at discharge. The patient remains hospitalized at the time of the summary. 4. Finasteride initiation is documented under \\'Problem #7: Prostatomegaly\\' but is explicitly stated to be for prostatomegaly management, not UTI prevention. While finasteride may indirectly reduce UTI risk in prostatomegaly, the stated indication in the text does not match the fact\\'s specific claim of UTI prevention.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 9, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling, DVT US negative, unclear etiology \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that bilateral extremity swelling is mentioned, but with some differences from the specific fact we\\'re looking for. The summary mentions right lower extremity (RLE) and left lower extremity (LLE) swelling in both the Secondary Diagnoses section and as Problem #6. However, the fact we\\'re looking for specifically mentions right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling, which differs from what\\'s documented. Additionally, while the summary mentions a plan to \\'Perform ultrasound of both extremities to rule out DVT\\' under Problem #6, it doesn\\'t explicitly state that DVT US was negative or that the etiology was unclear. Since the anatomical locations differ (RLE/LLE vs. RUE/LLE) and the DVT ultrasound results aren\\'t mentioned, we cannot consider this fact as explicitly present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'Right Lower Extremity (RLE) and Left Lower Extremity (LLE) swelling\\' under Problem #6, indicating that there is swelling in the lower extremities. However, it does not explicitly mention \\'Right upper extremity swelling.\\' The summary states that an ultrasound was performed to rule out DVT, but the specific finding of \\'DVT US negative\\' is not directly mentioned in the provided summary. The fact \\'Right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling, DVT US negative, unclear etiology\\' is not entirely mentioned because \\'Right upper extremity swelling\\' is not documented; only \\'Right Lower Extremity (RLE) and Left Lower Extremity (LLE) swelling\\' are noted.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'Right lower extremity (RLE) and left lower extremity (LLE) swelling\\' in both the Secondary Diagnoses and Problem #6. However, the specific fact being checked includes right upper extremity swelling, which is not documented anywhere in the summary. Additionally, while the summary states that ultrasounds were planned to rule out DVT, it explicitly notes \\'Awaiting ultrasound results\\' under Problem #6, meaning the DVT US results (negative or otherwise) are not yet reported. The etiology is implied to be unclear due to pending investigations, but the combination of right upper extremity involvement and confirmed negative DVT US is absent. The discrepancy in extremity location (upper vs. lower) and lack of finalized ultrasound results preclude a direct match to the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 10, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** The patient also was found to have cirrhosis of the liver but has compensated disease \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After analyzing the hospital course summary, while cirrhosis is mentioned multiple times (in the medical history and secondary diagnoses sections), there is no explicit mention that the cirrhosis is compensated. The summary includes diagnostic information about the liver, noting \\'cirrhotic liver morphology\\' on ultrasound and mentions elevated liver enzymes, but does not specify the state of compensation. While various aspects of the patient\\'s liver condition are discussed, including negative autoimmune hepatitis panel and normal ceruloplasmin, the specific fact about compensated disease is not stated. Therefore, while we know the patient has cirrhosis, we cannot confirm from this summary that it is explicitly described as compensated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly lists \\'cirrhosis\\' in both the medical history and secondary diagnoses. The abdominal ultrasound confirmed \\'cirrhotic liver morphology.\\' However, the term \\'compensated disease\\' or any explicit clinical equivalent (e.g., \\'no decompensation,\\' \\'stable cirrhosis without complications\\') is absent. While the summary notes the cirrhosis is \\'stable\\' in the problem based section, \\'stable\\' does not strictly equate to \\'compensated\\' in clinical terminology, as stability could refer to management status rather than the absence of decompensation. The absence of explicit phrasing indicating compensated disease (e.g., no ascites, varices, or encephalopathy mentioned) supports the conclusion.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 10, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** The patient had alcohol ketosis on presentation \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the entire hospital course summary, searching for any mention of alcohol ketosis or related metabolic conditions on presentation. The analysis revealed: 1. The primary reason for admission was alcohol withdrawal syndrome 2. While various metabolic and laboratory findings were mentioned (including liver enzymes, sodium, potassium, and lactate levels), there was no explicit mention of ketosis 3. The diagnostic investigations section lists several test results but does not include ketone levels or mention ketosis 4. The patient\\'s alcohol related diagnosis is specifically coded as alcohol withdrawal syndrome (F10.930) without mention of ketosis 5. While the patient clearly had alcohol related issues, ketosis was not documented as a presenting condition or complication\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'alcohol ketosis\\' in any section. The summary discusses alcohol withdrawal syndrome, polysubstance abuse disorder, and cirrhosis, among other conditions, but does not directly reference \\'alcohol ketosis.\\' While alcohol withdrawal and cirrhosis are related to alcohol use, \\'alcohol ketosis\\' is a specific condition that is not mentioned in the provided text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'alcohol ketosis\\' or equivalent terms (e.g., ketonemia, ketonuria, metabolic acidosis from alcohol) in any section. While the patient was admitted for alcohol withdrawal and had diagnostic tests (e.g., normal lactate, low electrolytes), there is no direct reference to ketosis, ketone testing, or clinical findings consistent with alcohol induced ketosis. The treatment included D5 NS IV fluids and thiamine, which are commonly used in alcohol related conditions, but these interventions are not specific to ketosis. The absence of explicit documentation of ketosis or its synonyms in the summary indicates it was not mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 12, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient sent to the hospital from home for symptoms of tachycardia, hypotension, found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula\\n\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient was admitted for hypotension and tachycardia, and confirms the presence of a gallbladder enteric fistula. However, the summary specifies the fistula was \\'formed\\' during prior HIPEC (a previous surgical procedure), indicating it is not a new finding. While the admission was prompted by symptoms (tachycardia, hypotension) and the fistula is part of the primary diagnosis, the summary does not describe the fistula as \\'new\\'—instead, it is presented as a pre existing complication of prior surgery. The fact requires confirmation of a new fistula, which is absent in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 12, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was started on empiric antibiotics but was found to have a normal WBC with normal lactate and abx were discontinued, he was not discharged on antibiotics\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary, looking specifically for mentions of antibiotic administration and discontinuation. While the summary mentions several medical conditions and treatments, including HIPEC, TPN, and wound care, it does not explicitly state anything about empiric antibiotics being started and then discontinued due to normal WBC and lactate. The diagnostic section mentions an elevated WBC count at some point, but there is no mention of it normalizing or affecting antibiotic decisions. Additionally, there is no mention of lactate levels or antibiotic status at discharge. Therefore, while the summary is quite detailed in other aspects of care, this specific sequence of events regarding antibiotics is not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention that the patient was started on empiric antibiotics, had a normal WBC with normal lactate, and that antibiotics were discontinued. It also does not mention whether the patient was discharged on antibiotics. The summary does mention elevated white blood cell count (WBC) during the hospital stay, indicating a possible infection or inflammation, but it does not provide information about the initiation, continuation, or discontinuation of antibiotics. Therefore, the specific fact regarding the use and discontinuation of antibiotics is not present in the provided summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention the initiation and subsequent discontinuation of empiric antibiotics based on normal WBC and lactate. While the \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\' section notes an elevated WBC (contradicting the \\'normal WBC\\' in the fact), there is no reference to lactate levels, antibiotic administration, or their discontinuation. The \\'Medications\\' section and discharge plan also lack any mention of antibiotics. The absence of these specific details indicates the fact is not stated in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 12, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was discharged on TPN with instructions to follow up in 4 weeks  \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully analyzed both formats of the hospital course summary, searching for explicit mention of discharge on TPN with 4 week follow up instructions. While the summary does mention TPN multiple times (e.g., \\'Continue TPN and monitor nutritional status\\' and mentions of home infusion therapy with Soleo Health for TPN), and discusses discharge planning with home health services, it does not specifically state that the patient was instructed to follow up in 4 weeks. The summary indicates follow up is needed but does not specify the 4 week timeframe. Therefore, while one part of the fact (TPN at discharge) is present, the complete fact including the specific follow up timeline is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary indicates that the patient was discharged on Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) as part of their home health services. It is mentioned under \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge\\' and \\'Problem #2: Failure to Thrive\\' that the patient was to continue TPN. However, the specific instruction to follow up in 4 weeks is not explicitly mentioned in the provided summary. The discharge plan includes home health services and follow up for various conditions, but the exact timing of \\'4 weeks\\' for follow up is not stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) The \\'Medications\\' section explicitly states the patient was discharged with \\'home infusion therapy... for Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)\\'. 2) The \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' in both formats and the Conclusion mention TPN as part of home care. 3) However, the specific instruction to \\'follow up in 4 weeks\\' is not found anywhere in the summary. While follow up is mentioned generally in the Conclusion (\\'regular outpatient follow up\\'), no time frame of 4 weeks is specified. 4) The combination of TPN discharge and 4 week follow up must both be present for the fact to be considered mentioned. Since the time specific follow up instruction is absent, the complete fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary indicates that Seraphina L Plant was admitted for bilateral complete mastectomies and right axillary lymph node dissection due to invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast. The summary states that \\'Upon discharge, Seraphina was stable with a comprehensive plan in place to manage her primary diagnosis of breast cancer and associated comorbidities.\\' It also mentions that \\'The patient\\'s postoperative course was complicated by poorly controlled diabetes,\\' but overall, her postoperative pain was effectively managed, and she was discharged in a stable condition. The key information to look for is whether the patient had breast cancer, was admitted for bilateral mastectomy, had an unremarkable postoperative course, and was discharged home. The summary confirms the patient had breast cancer and underwent bilateral mastectomy. It also indicates a stable postoperative condition, although complicated by poorly controlled diabetes. There is no explicit mention of the postoperative course being \\'unremarkable,\\' but it does state that the patient was \\'stable postoperatively.\\' The summary does confirm that she was discharged home, as it states \\'Upon discharge, Seraphina was stable.\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 13, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt has significant mental health history including anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder and did have a panic attack while admitted \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact about mental health history and panic attack can be analyzed in two parts: 1. Mental health history: The summary explicitly mentions multiple psychiatric conditions including anxiety, bipolar disorder, PTSD, and borderline personality disorder in both the \\'Relevant Medical History\\' section and Problem #3. These match exactly with the conditions mentioned in the fact. 2. Panic attack during admission: While the summary mentions the patient\\'s psychiatric medications were continued and that psychiatric symptoms were monitored, there is NO explicit mention of a panic attack occurring during the admission. The summary only mentions a history of \\'anxiety attacks\\' but does not document any acute panic attack during this hospital stay.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides a detailed account of Seraphina L Plant\\'s admission and treatment. Under \\'Relevant Medical History,\\' it is mentioned that she has a history of bipolar disorder, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, and anxiety attacks. In the \\'Problem Based Summary\\' section, her bipolar disorder is listed as Problem #3, indicating that her psychiatric conditions were being managed during the hospital stay. The summary states that she was continued on psychiatric medications (buspirone, quetiapine, trazodone) and that her mental health conditions were closely monitored. However, there is no explicit mention of a panic attack occurring during the admission.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly lists the patient\\'s mental health history as including bipolar disorder, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, and anxiety attacks in the \\'Relevant Medical History\\' and \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\' sections. However, there is no mention of a panic attack occurring during the admission. While the psychiatric conditions are clearly documented, the specific event of a panic attack while admitted is absent from any section of the summary, including progress notes and problem based summaries. The absence of this acute event means the full fact (history + in hospital panic attack) is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that the text actually indicates the opposite of the fact we\\'re looking for. Specifically: 1. Under Problem #2: Diabetes Mellitus, it states \\'Poorly controlled diabetes with elevated glucose levels\\' 2. The progress note analysis mentions \\'glucose levels remained elevated, with readings of 195, 207, and 162 mg/dL\\' 3. The conclusion explicitly states that the \\'patient\\'s postoperative course was complicated by poorly controlled diabetes\\' These statements directly contradict the fact we\\'re looking for, which suggests DM2 was not worsened perioperatively. The evidence shows that her diabetes control actually deteriorated during the perioperative period, requiring insulin sliding scale adjustments.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about Seraphina\\'s medical history, surgical procedures, and postoperative care. It mentions that she has diabetes mellitus (DM) and that her glucose readings were consistently elevated, indicating poorly controlled diabetes. The summary also notes that an insulin sliding scale was implemented due to these elevated glucose levels and that her diabetes management plan required further adjustment. However, it does not explicitly state that her chronic medical conditions, including DM2, were not worsened perioperatively. Instead, it highlights that her diabetes was poorly controlled and required adjustments to her insulin regimen. The absence of a direct statement regarding the perioperative worsening of her chronic conditions, including DM2, requires careful interpretation. The information provided indicates management and monitoring of her conditions without explicitly stating they were not worsened.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that Seraphina\\'s diabetes mellitus (DM2) was poorly controlled with elevated glucose levels requiring insulin regimen adjustments, but it does not explicitly state whether her chronic conditions, including DM2, were or were not worsened perioperatively. While the text documents ongoing management of her diabetes and other comorbidities, there is no direct assertion that these conditions remained stable or were unaffected by the surgical intervention. The absence of explicit language addressing perioperative exacerbation (e.g., \\'no worsening of chronic conditions\\' or \\'DM2 remained stable\\') means the fact is not confirmed as stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 14, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Acute lower extremity weakness caused by nerve root compression from neurofibromas, with no evidence of spinal cord compression as shown on MRI.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** Step 1: Identify key elements of the fact: (1) acute lower extremity weakness caused by nerve root compression from neurofibromas, and (2) absence of spinal cord compression on MRI. Step 2: The summary explicitly states in the Primary Diagnosis and MRI findings that neurofibromas caused nerve root compression leading to lower extremity weakness. Step 3: While the MRI is mentioned as showing nerve root compression, there is no explicit statement about the absence of spinal cord compression. The summary does not mention spinal cord status at all. Step 4: Since the absence of spinal cord compression (a critical component of the fact) is not documented, even a negative form (e.g., \\'no cord compression\\'), the full fact cannot be considered explicitly stated. The presence of nerve root compression alone does not confirm the absence of spinal cord involvement.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 14, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bevacizumab was initiated during hospitalization\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed both the standard section based summary and the problem based summary looking for any mention of bevacizumab initiation. I specifically checked: 1) The Therapeutic Procedures Performed section, 2) The Medications section, 3) Each problem based entry, and 4) The treatment descriptions throughout the text. The medication list is comprehensive but does not include bevacizumab. No mention of bevacizumab (or its trade names like Avastin) appears anywhere in the hospital course summary. The only new medication clearly initiated during the hospitalization was dexamethasone for adrenal insufficiency management.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if \\'Bevacizumab was initiated during hospitalization\\' is mentioned in the hospital course summary, I will examine both the Standard Section Based Summary and the Problem Based Summary. In the Standard Section Based Summary, I will check sections like \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' and \\'Medications\\' for any mention of Bevacizumab. In the Problem Based Summary, I will review each problem section for any reference to Bevacizumab. Upon reviewing both summaries, there is no mention of Bevacizumab in the \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\', \\'Medications\\', or in any of the problem sections. Therefore, the fact that Bevacizumab was initiated during hospitalization is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis involved reviewing both the Standard Section Based Summary and Problem Based Summary. In the \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' and \\'Medications\\' sections of the hospital course summary, Bevacizumab is not listed. The medications and treatments explicitly mentioned include dexamethasone, enoxaparin, methadone, dilaudid, alendronate, and others, but no reference to Bevacizumab or its synonyms (e.g., Avastin) appears. The Problem Based Summary also does not mention Bevacizumab in any of the problem specific management plans. Since Bevacizumab is not stated verbatim, paraphrased, abbreviated, or referenced via clinical synonyms in any section, the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 14, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Dexamethasone taper was started\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that while dexamethasone administration is explicitly mentioned multiple times (including \\'20 mg IV every 6 hours, transitioning to 4 mg TID\\' in section 7 and similar details in section 8), there is no explicit mention of a dexamethasone taper being started. The summary shows changes in dexamethasone dosing (from 20mg IV to 4mg TID) but does not specifically indicate that a taper plan was initiated. The term \\'taper\\' or any clear description of a gradual dose reduction plan is not present in either the standard section based summary or the problem based summary. Even in the sections discussing adrenal insufficiency and medications, while dexamethasone is mentioned, there is no explicit reference to a tapering schedule.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient was managed with dexamethasone for adrenal insufficiency. Under \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' and \\'Medications\\', it is stated that dexamethasone was initiated at a dose of 20 mg IV followed by 4 mg q6h, transitioning to 4 mg TID. However, there is no explicit mention of a \\'dexamethasone taper\\' being started. The summary does mention that the patient was continued on dexamethasone at discharge under \\'Problem #5: Adrenal Insufficiency\\', but it does not specify a taper regimen. Thus, the fact of starting a dexamethasone taper is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary, focusing particularly on the \\'Primary Diagnosis\\' and discharge information sections. The summary explicitly states in the \\'Primary Diagnosis\\' section that the principal diagnosis was \\'acute kidney injury (AKI) superimposed on chronic heart failure (HFrEF) and pre existing end stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to lupus nephritis.\\' While nausea and vomiting were mentioned as presenting symptoms and secondary diagnoses, viral gastroenteritis is not mentioned anywhere in the summary as either a primary or secondary diagnosis. The nausea and vomiting were attributed to the patient\\'s other conditions, particularly the AKI exacerbation. Therefore, viral gastroenteritis was not listed as the principal diagnosis at discharge.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' as the principal diagnosis at discharge. The primary diagnosis listed is acute kidney injury (AKI) superimposed on chronic heart failure (HFrEF) and pre existing end stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to lupus nephritis. The summary discusses various diagnoses and the patient\\'s condition at discharge, but viral gastroenteritis is not mentioned in any section, including the \\'Reason for Admission,\\' \\'Primary Diagnosis,\\' \\'Secondary Diagnoses,\\' or \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge.\\' Therefore, the fact is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly lists the primary diagnosis as \\'acute kidney injury (AKI) superimposed on chronic heart failure (HFrEF) and pre existing end stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to lupus nephritis\\' in both the \\'Primary Diagnosis\\' section and the conclusion. Secondary diagnoses include nausea/vomiting and suspected infection, but there is no mention of \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' in any section (including primary diagnosis, secondary diagnoses, problem based summary, or conclusion). While nausea/vomiting are present as symptoms, the summary attributes these to AKI and other chronic conditions rather than a viral etiology. No clinical synonyms or abbreviations for viral gastroenteritis (e.g., \\'gastroenteritis,\\' \\'norovirus,\\' \\'infectious diarrhea\\') are present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 15, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** The patient presented with acute kidney injury in the context of a renal transplant, with a serum creatinine level elevated to 3.9 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.4 mg/dL.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, the specific fact about creatinine levels (3.9 mg/dL from baseline 1.4 mg/dL) is not explicitly mentioned. While the summary does indicate that: 1. The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) in the context of a kidney transplant (mentioned multiple times) 2. Laboratory tests showed \\'elevated creatinine\\' (mentioned in the Key Diagnostic Investigations section) However, the specific creatinine values (3.9 mg/dL and baseline 1.4 mg/dL) are not provided anywhere in the text. The summary only mentions that creatinine was elevated without specifying the exact values or the degree of elevation from baseline.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that Jeanette Slay was admitted due to an exacerbation of acute kidney injury (AKI) superimposed on chronic heart failure (HFrEF) and pre existing end stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to lupus nephritis, with a history of a deceased donor kidney transplant. The summary also states that laboratory tests showed elevated creatinine. However, it does not explicitly state the specific serum creatinine level or compare it to a baseline value. The fact that the patient presented with acute kidney injury in the context of a renal transplant is mentioned, but the specific creatinine levels (elevated to 3.9 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.4 mg/dL) are not provided in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions the patient\\'s acute kidney injury (AKI) in the context of a renal transplant under \\'Reason for Admission\\' and \\'Relevant Surgical History.\\' However, while \\'elevated creatinine\\' is noted in the diagnostic investigations, the specific serum creatinine level of 3.9 mg/dL and baseline of 1.4 mg/dL are not provided. The summary states AKI and transplant history but lacks numerical creatinine values, which are critical components of the specified fact. Since the exact values or their equivalents (e.g., \\'creatinine increased from 1.4 to 3.9\\') are absent, the full fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**34. Patient 15, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily stopped when the patient initially came to the hospital.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that while tacrolimus was explicitly mentioned as being discontinued (section 7 and 8), and mycophenolate and prednisone were mentioned as new medications administered, there is no explicit statement that all three immunosuppressant medications were temporarily stopped together at admission. The summary indicates that tacrolimus was discontinued due to concerns about AKI and HFrEF, while mycophenolate and prednisone are actually listed as new medications that were administered. This suggests a modification of the immunosuppressive regimen rather than a complete temporary cessation of all three medications. Since the fact we\\'re looking for specifically requires that all three medications were temporarily stopped at admission, and this is not explicitly stated in the text, we must conclude this fact is not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states that tacrolimus was discontinued (under \\'Medications\\' in the Standard Section Based Summary). Mycophenolate and prednisone are listed as \\'new medications administered\\' in the same section. However, there is no explicit mention that mycophenolate and prednisone were temporarily stopped upon admission. The term \\'new medications\\' suggests they were either newly initiated or continued, but the summary does not clearly indicate they were held initially. Since only tacrolimus is explicitly documented as discontinued, the specific fact about all three immunosuppressants being stopped is not fully addressed.\\n\\n\\n\\n**35. Patient 16, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Currently on high dose dexamethasone and Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step: 1. The summary mentions dexamethasone in two places: In section 8 of the Standard Summary: \\'dexamethasone was initiated for edema management\\' In the Problem Based Summary under Brain Metastases: \\'continuation of high dose steroids\\' 2. While this confirms high dose steroid (dexamethasone) use, there is no mention of: Bactrim anywhere in the text Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis 3. Even though it would be standard practice to give PJP prophylaxis to patients on high dose steroids, we cannot assume it was prescribed if not explicitly stated. 4. Since only part of the fact (dexamethasone use) is mentioned but the critical components of Bactrim and PJP prophylaxis are missing, we cannot consider this fact as fully present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that dexamethasone was initiated for edema management and that the patient was to continue \\'high dose steroids\\' as part of the discharge plan for \\'Brain Metastases with Vasogenic Edema.\\' However, there is no explicit mention of Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis in the provided summary. The fact that the patient is on high dose dexamethasone is supported by the information given, but the use of Bactrim is not mentioned anywhere in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'dexamethasone was initiated for edema management\\' in the Medications section. 2. The Problem Based Summary states \\'continuation of high dose steroids\\' under Brain Metastases\\' discharge plan, confirming high dose dexamethasone use. 3. No mention of Bactrim (trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole) or Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis is found in any section of the summary. 4. While dexamethasone dose and indication are addressed, the combination with Bactrim for PJP prophylaxis is not documented. 5. The absence of any reference to antimicrobial prophylaxis or Bactrim use meets criteria for 0 according to guidelines.\\n\\n\\n\\n**36. Patient 17, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Delirium tremens requiring intravenous benzodiazepines and phenobarbital for symptom control\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I find that while the patient was treated for alcohol withdrawal with benzodiazepines (LORazepam/Ativan) and phenobarbital, there is no explicit mention that the patient experienced delirium tremens (DT) specifically. The summary mentions \\'moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal\\' with \\'perceptual disturbances, hallucinations, and tremulousness,\\' but these symptoms, while concerning, don\\'t automatically equate to DT. Additionally, while both benzodiazepines (Ativan PRN) and phenobarbital were used, the summary doesn\\'t explicitly state they were required for DT management. The medications could have been used prophylactically or for general withdrawal management. Without specific documentation of delirium tremens in the diagnosis or clinical course, we cannot definitively say this fact is present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient was managed with phenobarbital for withdrawal and LORazepam (Ativan) PRN for agitation or seizures. While it indicates the use of phenobarbital and a benzodiazepine (LORazepam), it does not explicitly state that delirium tremens was the condition being treated or that intravenous benzodiazepines were used. The summary does mention \\'perceptual disturbances, hallucinations, and tremulousness,\\' which are symptoms that could be associated with delirium tremens, and it notes the use of phenobarbital and LORazepam. However, the specific fact of \\'delirium tremens requiring intravenous benzodiazepines and phenobarbital for symptom control\\' is not explicitly mentioned because the route of benzodiazepine administration is not specified.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary states the patient had \\'acute ethanol withdrawal syndrome with perceptual disturbance\\' but does not explicitly use the term \\'delirium tremens\\' (DT). 2. Treatment included phenobarbital and PRN lorazepam (a benzodiazepine), but the summary does not specify intravenous administration of benzodiazepines (only \\'PRN for agitation or seizures\\' with no route mentioned). 3. While the clinical scenario aligns with DT management, the explicit fact (DT + IV benzodiazepines + phenobarbital) is not directly stated. The absence of the term \\'delirium tremens\\' and unclear route for benzodiazepines prevent meeting the threshold for explicit mention.\\n\\n\\n\\n**37. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze this step by step: 1. The summary mentions that the patient was admitted with and remained febrile (\\'fever of unknown origin\\' at admission and \\'remained febrile\\' at discharge) 2. Diagnostic workup for infection was performed and was negative: Blood cultures showed no growth Urinalysis was negative for infection 3. Despite negative infectious workup, the patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime) 4. The patient\\'s condition at discharge notes persistent fever (\\'remained febrile\\') 5. While pulmonary infection is not explicitly mentioned as a suspected source, the use of broad spectrum antibiotics and persistent fever despite negative workup is clearly documented While most elements are present (persistent fever, negative workup), the specific suspicion of pulmonary infection is not explicitly mentioned in the text. Therefore, we cannot definitively say this exact fact is present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions persistent fever (patient remained febrile at discharge) and negative infectious workups (blood cultures with no growth, negative urinalysis). However, there is no mention of a suspected pulmonary infection. The fever is attributed to neutropenic fever and CNS lymphoma involvement, with no reference to pulmonary infection in the diagnoses, investigations, or discharge plans. While infectious workups were negative, the suspected source is not pulmonary. Thus, the specific combination of \\'persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative workups\\' is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**38. Patient 18, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma recently complicated by progression to CNS lymphoma\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'high grade B cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 translocations\\' as the primary diagnosis and repeatedly references \\'CNS lymphoma progression\\' or \\'CNS involvement\\' in multiple sections (Reason for Admission, Medical History, Secondary Diagnoses, Conclusion). However, the term \\'Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)\\' is not used anywhere in the text. While high grade B cell lymphoma with MYC/BCL2 rearrangements (double hit lymphoma) is clinically related to DLBCL, they are distinct entities in modern classification systems. The summary does not use DLBCL terminology, synonyms, or abbreviations. The progression to CNS lymphoma is clearly documented, but the specific lymphoma subtype mentioned in the fact (DLBCL) is absent. Thus, the fact as phrased is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**39. Patient 18, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary for mention of acute kidney injury with hypokalemia that resolved during admission. Here\\'s my step by step analysis: 1. First, I found that AKI is mentioned in two places: In the Secondary Diagnoses section as \\'acute kidney injury (AKI)\\' In the Problem Based Summary under \\'Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)\\' 2. Regarding resolution: The Problem Based Summary explicitly states \\'Resolved with IV fluid resuscitation and electrolyte management\\' It also notes \\'renal function has normalized\\' under Outstanding/Pending Issues 3. However, regarding hypokalemia: While electrolyte management is mentioned, hypokalemia specifically is not explicitly stated anywhere in the text The summary mentions \\'electrolyte management\\' but does not specify which electrolytes were abnormal Therefore, while the AKI and its resolution are clearly documented, the specific presence of hypokalemia is not mentioned. Since the fact we\\'re looking for requires both components (AKI with hypokalemia AND resolution), and one component (hypokalemia) is missing, I cannot confirm this specific fact is fully present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly lists \\'acute kidney injury (AKI)\\' as a secondary diagnosis. In the Problem Based Summary under \\'Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)\\', it states: \\'Current Clinical Status: Resolved with IV fluid resuscitation and electrolyte management.\\' While the resolution of AKI is clearly documented, the summary does not mention hypokalemia (low potassium) at any point. The phrase \\'electrolyte management\\' is nonspecific and could refer to any electrolyte imbalance. There is no explicit reference to hypokalemia, its presence, or its resolution in the text. Since the fact requires both AKI and hypokalemia resolution, and only AKI resolution is documented, the specific combination is not mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**40. Patient 19, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis).\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I find that while hydronephrosis and UTIs are both mentioned, the specific fact about hydronephrosis being complicated by UTIs with ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis is not explicitly stated. Here\\'s the step by step analysis: 1. The summary mentions bilateral hydronephrosis as part of the medical history and secondary diagnoses 2. UTIs are mentioned multiple times: Complicated UTI/CAUTI as reason for admission Recurrent UTIs in medical history ESBL E. coli is mentioned only in context of Augmentin resistance 3. However, the summary does not: Explicitly link hydronephrosis as being complicated by the UTIs Mention Klebsiella or Enterococcus faecalis at all State a causal or complicating relationship between the hydronephrosis and the infections While these conditions co exist in the patient, the specific relationship and all three organisms are not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, medical history, and diagnoses. The \\'Relevant Medical History\\' section mentions \\'bilateral hydronephrosis\\' as a pre existing condition. The \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\' section also lists \\'chronic bilateral hydronephrosis\\'. Furthermore, under \\'Problem Based Summary\\', \\'Problem #3: Chronic Bilateral Hydronephrosis\\' is discussed, indicating that the condition is stable and being monitored. The \\'Reason for Admission\\' and \\'Primary Diagnosis\\' sections highlight a complicated UTI associated with CAUTI, and the causative organisms are mentioned in the \\'Medications\\' section where it is noted that Augmentin was discontinued due to ESBL E. coli resistance. The presence of ESBL E. coli is directly related to the UTI. Additionally, the \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\' section shows evidence of infection (WBC 51 100, rare bacteria, mod pseudo hyphae, many yeast in urinalysis). While the summary does not explicitly list \\'Klebsiella\\' and \\'Enterococcus faecalis\\' as causative organisms alongside ESBL E. coli, it does confirm the presence of hydronephrosis and a complicated UTI with ESBL E. coli. The fact that hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections, specifically mentioning ESBL E. coli, is supported. However, the other organisms (Klebsiella and Enterococcus faecalis) are not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly lists \\'chronic bilateral hydronephrosis\\' in the medical history and secondary diagnoses. It also states that Augmentin was discontinued due to ESBL E. coli resistance, and ertapenem (a carbapenem antibiotic typically used for ESBL organisms) was initiated. However, the summary does not explicitly state that hydronephrosis is complicated by UTIs caused by ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, or Enterococcus faecalis. While ESBL E. coli is mentioned in the context of antibiotic resistance, there is no direct linkage between hydronephrosis and these specific pathogens. The urine culture results are not detailed, and Klebsiella/Enterococcus are not mentioned. The association between hydronephrosis and these organisms is implied but not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**41. Patient 19, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Chronic opioid use and opioid-related constipation. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I find no explicit mention of chronic opioid use or opioid related constipation. While the patient has several chronic conditions and a history of polysubstance use disorder (PSUD), there is no specific mention of ongoing opioid use. The medication list includes pregabalin for phantom limb pain and neuropathy, but does not mention any opioid medications. Additionally, there is no mention of constipation as a symptom or problem in any of the problem based summaries or the standard section based summary. While the patient\\'s complex medical history and PSUD might suggest the possibility of opioid use, we cannot infer this without explicit documentation. The fact we are looking for requires both chronic opioid use AND opioid related constipation to be mentioned, and neither component is explicitly stated in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides a detailed account of the patient\\'s admission and treatment. The \\'Relevant Medical History\\' section lists \\'polysubstance use disorder (PSUD)\\' among the patient\\'s pre existing conditions. While this indicates a history of substance use, it does not explicitly mention \\'chronic opioid use.\\' However, \\'polysubstance use disorder\\' can imply the use of multiple substances, potentially including opioids. The summary does not directly address \\'opioid related constipation.\\' To determine if \\'chronic opioid use\\' is mentioned, we look for any direct or indirect references. The presence of \\'phantom limb pain and neuropathy\\' treated with \\'pregabalin\\' suggests chronic pain management, which might involve opioids, but this is not explicitly stated. The summary does not directly mention \\'chronic opioid use\\' or \\'opioid related constipation.\\'\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed in detail. The \\'Relevant Medical History\\' includes polysubstance use disorder (PSUD), but there is no explicit mention of chronic opioid use. Medications listed (pregabalin for pain) do not include opioids. The term \\'opioid related constipation\\' or equivalent phrasing (e.g., \\'OIC\\') is absent in all sections, including diagnoses, medications, and problem lists. While PSUD could theoretically include opioids, the summary does not specify opioid use, and no constipation related to opioids is documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**42. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary step by step: 1. First, I searched for mentions of thrombocytopenia, which is explicitly mentioned multiple times throughout the summary, including \\'progressive thrombocytopenia\\' in the admission reason. 2. Next, I looked for evidence of prednisone taper initiation. The summary mentions that prednisone 40mg daily was started for suspected Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) in both the \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' and \\'Medications\\' sections. 3. However, while the summary shows that prednisone was initiated, it does not explicitly mention that this was a \\'taper\\' or that it was started specifically in response to \\'worsening\\' thrombocytopenia. 4. Although we can see that thrombocytopenia was an ongoing issue (with platelet counts of 42 and 60 mentioned), and prednisone was started as treatment, the specific elements of \\'worsening\\' and \\'taper\\' are not explicitly stated in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient was started on prednisone 40mg daily for suspected Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) as part of the therapeutic procedures performed during hospitalization. The summary under \\'Problem #2: Progressive Thrombocytopenia\\' states that the patient\\'s current clinical status was stable with prednisone therapy. However, it does not explicitly mention a \\'prednisone taper initiation\\'. The discharge plan for Problem #2 includes monitoring the platelet count and adjusting medications as needed, which implies potential future adjustments to prednisone, but does not directly state that a taper was initiated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'progressive thrombocytopenia\\' which is a clear synonym for \\'worsening thrombocytopenia.\\' It also documents the \\'initiation of prednisone 40mg daily\\' for suspected ITP. However, the summary does not mention a prednisone taper (i.e., a planned dose reduction over time), only the initiation of therapy. Since \\'taper\\' is a specific aspect of the fact that is absent, the full fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**43. Patient 20, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the entire hospital course summary, including both the section based and problem based portions, as well as the conclusion. While the summary mentions the need to monitor platelet counts multiple times (particularly in the context of fondaparinux dosing and general disease management), it does not explicitly state that CBCs were ordered twice weekly after discharge. The closest references are general statements about monitoring platelet counts, such as \\'monitor platelet count, adjust medications as needed\\' in the discharge plans, but the specific frequency of twice weekly CBC monitoring is not mentioned anywhere in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was thoroughly reviewed to determine if the fact \\'Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\' was explicitly mentioned. The summary includes detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, medical history, diagnostic investigations, therapeutic procedures, and discharge plan. Under \\'Problem #1: Extension of RLE DVT\\' and \\'Problem #2: Progressive Thrombocytopenia\\' in the Problem Based Summary, it is mentioned that the discharge plan includes \\'monitor platelet count.\\' However, the specific frequency of monitoring, such as \\'twice weekly CBCs,\\' is not explicitly stated in the provided summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions monitoring platelet count as part of the discharge plan for both the DVT and thrombocytopenia. However, the specific frequency of \\'twice weekly CBCs\\' is not explicitly stated. The text uses phrases like \\'monitor platelet count\\' and \\'close monitoring\\' without specifying the exact schedule. While monitoring is clearly required, the absence of \\'twice weekly\\' or equivalent phrasing (e.g., \\'every 3 4 days\\') means the fact is not explicitly documented as per the provided summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**44. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary to determine if there is explicit mention of recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient. Here\\'s my analysis: 1. While falls are mentioned multiple times in the summary, they are not described as being of unknown etiology during the hospital stay 2. The falls mentioned are: Initial fall that led to admission with T6 fracture History of recurrent falls attributed to \\'gait instability and hesitancy in using a walker\\' 3. There is no mention of: New falls occurring during the hospital stay An extensive workup specifically for falls during the admission Falls of unknown etiology during the admission 4. The summary actually provides known contributing factors to the patient\\'s fall risk (gait instability, medications like gabapentin which was discontinued) Therefore, while falls are a significant part of the patient\\'s history, the specific fact we\\'re looking for (recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient) is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'recurrent falls due to gait instability and hesitancy in using a walker\\' in the medical history and problem list. However, it does not state that the falls are of unknown etiology or that an extensive inpatient workup was performed. The text attributes the falls to identifiable factors (gait instability, walker hesitancy) and while diagnostic investigations (e.g., CT scans, echocardiogram) are listed, they are not explicitly framed as part of a fall etiology workup. The summary lacks language indicating uncertainty about the cause of falls despite evaluation, which is required for the specified fact. Thus, the exact phrasing \\'recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\' is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**45. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I reviewed the hospital course summary carefully, looking for any indication that the T6 wedge compression fracture predated the most recent fall. Here\\'s my analysis: 1. The admission note mentions a T6 wedge compression fracture following a fall at home 2. The fracture is described as \\'subacute\\' in the Primary Diagnosis section 3. However, there is no explicit statement or indication that this fracture existed before the most recent fall 4. While the patient has a history of recurrent falls, there is no temporal relationship established between previous falls and this specific fracture 5. The summary does not contain any comparison with prior imaging or mention of fracture age/timing relative to the current fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that Selma Toosi was admitted following a fall at home, which resulted in a closed wedge compression fracture of the T6 vertebra. The primary diagnosis is listed as subacute T6 compression fracture. However, the summary does not explicitly state that the T6 wedge compression fracture likely happened before the most recent fall. The information provided suggests the fracture occurred due to the recent fall, as indicated in the \\'Reason for Admission\\' section. There is no clear indication or statement that the fracture occurred before this fall.\\n\\n\\n\\n**46. Patient 22, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of cholangitis occurring after or as a result of a recent biliary stent exchange. While the summary does mention both cholangitis (listed as a secondary diagnosis) and a biliary drain exchange procedure (listed under therapeutic procedures), it does not establish a temporal or causal relationship between these events that would indicate post procedural cholangitis. The cholangitis appears to be part of the patient\\'s presenting condition rather than a complication of the procedure. The summary indicates that there was actually improvement noted after the biliary drain exchange procedure, as stated in Problem #3: \\'Improvement noted with the biliary drain exchange procedure.\\' Therefore, while both elements (cholangitis and biliary procedure) are present in the text, the specific fact of post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'cholangitis\\' as a secondary diagnosis and describes a \\'biliary drain exchange\\' procedure performed during the hospitalization. However, the summary does not use the term \\'stent\\' (it refers to a \\'drain\\'), nor does it explicitly state that the cholangitis occurred \\'post procedurally\\' following a stent exchange. The cholangitis appears to have been part of the presenting condition (reason for admission) rather than a complication arising after the procedure. While the procedure (drain exchange) and cholangitis are both mentioned, the causal/temporal relationship implied by \\'post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\' is not explicitly stated, and the device type (stent vs. drain) differs.\\n\\n\\n\\n**47. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing both the standard and problem based sections of the hospital course summary, I cannot find any explicit mention of continuing or re evaluating Augmentin therapy for 14 days. While the summary does mention antibiotic therapy (specifically Zosyn) and discusses infection treatment, there is no specific reference to Augmentin or a 14 day course. The only antibiotic explicitly mentioned is Zosyn as empiric therapy. The summary discusses continuing antibiotic therapy in general terms (e.g., \\'Continue antibiotic therapy as needed\\'), but does not specifically address Augmentin or a 14 day duration plan. Therefore, this specific fact is not present in the hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention the decision to continue or re evaluate the continuation of Augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion. The summary mentions that the patient was treated with empiric Zosyn, and blood cultures grew Gram negative rods (GNRs), but it does not specifically discuss Augmentin therapy. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned in the provided summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions empiric Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) as part of the antibiotic regimen but does not reference Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate) at any point. Under Problem #2 (Sepsis), the discharge plan states \\'Continue antibiotic therapy as needed\\' but does not specify Augmentin or a plan to re evaluate its continuation before completing a 14 day course. Since Augmentin is not mentioned explicitly, and no equivalent antibiotic or re evaluation timeline matching the fact is documented, the specific fact about Augmentin therapy continuation/re evaluation is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**48. Patient 22, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** patient should follow up with Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/ Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Poultsides, George, MD in in 2 weeks\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing both the standard section based summary and the problem based summary, I find no explicit mention of follow up appointments with either an Advanced Practice Provider in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. While the summary discusses various follow up needs (such as diabetes monitoring, swallow center referral, and ongoing cancer treatment), it does not specify these particular appointments. The closest references are general mentions of \\'outpatient follow up\\' and \\'multidisciplinary care coordination,\\' but these do not specify the timing or providers mentioned in the fact we\\'re looking for. Since there is no explicit mention of these specific follow up appointments with the named providers and timeframes, this fact is not present in the hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was thoroughly reviewed to determine if the specific follow up instructions for the patient were mentioned. The summary includes a detailed account of the patient\\'s hospital course, diagnoses, treatments, and discharge condition. However, upon careful examination, there is no explicit mention of follow up appointments with an Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant) in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides, MD in 2 weeks in either the Standard Section Based Summary or the Problem Based Summary. The discharge plan and goals are discussed for various problems, but specific follow up instructions with the mentioned providers are not stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed in detail. The \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' sections in both the Standard and Problem Based summaries mention the need for outpatient follow up, multidisciplinary care coordination, and specific referrals (e.g., swallow center, speech pathologist). However, there is no explicit mention of follow up appointments with an Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant) in 1 week or with \\'Poultsides, George, MD\\' in 2 weeks. The text does not contain these specific provider names, roles, or the exact follow up timelines. While follow up is generally recommended, the specific fact in question is not stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**49. Patient 23, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary searching for any mention of the patient\\'s condition being \\'in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy.\\' While the summary mentions both CLL (the patient has Rai Stage II Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia) and mitral valve issues (patient had MVR with bioprosthetic valve replacement and has worsening mitral stenosis), it does not explicitly state that the patient\\'s current condition is occurring \\'in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy.\\' The summary discusses these conditions separately but does not specifically link them as a combined setting or cause for the patient\\'s current presentation. Even though both conditions are present, the specific phrasing or concept of them being a combined setting for the current situation is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'Rai Stage II Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)\\' in the patient\\'s medical history but does not state that the CLL is \\'progressing.\\' The term \\'progressing\\' or equivalent descriptors (e.g., \\'worsening,\\' \\'advancing\\') are absent in the CLL context. 2. \\'Mitral valvulopathy\\' is implied by the surgical history of mitral valve replacement (MVR) and echocardiogram findings of \\'worsening mitral stenosis,\\' which qualifies as valvulopathy. However, the exact phrase \\'mitral valvulopathy\\' or a direct synonym (e.g., \\'mitral valve disease\\') is not used. 3. While both CLL and mitral valve pathology are mentioned separately, the summary does not explicitly link the two conditions in a \\'setting\\' as required by the fact. The absence of explicit progression terminology for CLL and the lack of direct phrasing for \\'mitral valvulopathy\\' (despite describing mitral stenosis) result in the fact not being fully stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**50. Patient 23, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing both the standard section based summary and problem based summary, I found no explicit mention of cardiology coordinating follow up with the Heart Failure team regarding transcatheter MVR or a clinical trial drug in April 2023. While the summary does mention cardiology follow up in general terms (e.g., \\'follow up with a cardiologist\\' under Problem #1), and discusses the patient\\'s history of MVR (mitral valve replacement), it does not specifically mention the coordination for transcatheter MVR or any clinical trial discussion. The discharge plans and follow up sections do not contain this specific information either. Even though there is discussion of cardiac care and valve related history, the particular detail about coordinating with the Heart Failure team for transcatheter MVR and a clinical trial drug is not present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was thoroughly reviewed to determine if the fact \\'Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary includes detailed information about the patient\\'s hospital course, diagnoses, treatments, and discharge plans. Under \\'Problem #1: Heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)\\', it is mentioned that the discharge plan includes follow up with a cardiologist. However, there is no explicit mention of cardiology coordinating follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR or a new clinical trial drug.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1. Searched discharge plans and follow up sections in both summary formats. 2. Checked cardiology involvement mentions. 3. Scanned for \\'Heart Failure team\\', \\'transcatheter MVR\\', and \\'clinical trial drug 4/2023\\' references. 4. Found \\'follow up with a cardiologist\\' in HFpEF discharge plan but no mention of Heart Failure team coordination. 5. No references to transcatheter MVR procedures or clinical trial drugs (April 2023 or otherwise) in therapeutic procedures, medications, or discharge planning. 6. While medication changes (duvelisib) and valve replacements are mentioned, these don\\'t constitute the specific fact requested. The absence persists across all summary sections and problem lists.\\n\\n\\n\\n**51. Patient 24, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** this (and prior) small bowel obstruction managed nonoperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states that the current small bowel obstruction (SBO) was managed nonoperatively with enteral nutrition support via an NJ tube, NPO status, and nasogastric tube placement. However, while the summary mentions \\'multiple prior small bowel obstructions\\' and a history of \\'multiple surgeries for SBOs,\\' it does not explicitly state that prior SBOs were managed nonoperatively. The term \\'managed nonoperatively\\' in the medical history section refers to the patient\\'s cholangiocarcinoma, not the prior SBOs. Since the fact requires confirmation that both the current and prior SBOs were managed nonoperatively, and the prior SBOs were surgically treated, the fact as stated is not fully supported.\\n\\n\\n\\n**52. Patient 24, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, the specific fact about being \\'discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\' is not explicitly mentioned. While the summary discusses nutritional management extensively and mentions goals for transitioning to oral intake (e.g., \\'goal to transition to oral intake that meets more than 75% of his nutritional needs\\' and \\'advance the diet as tolerated to regular foods\\'), it does not specifically state the diet order at discharge. Additionally, while the summary discusses various medications (including D5 1/2 NS, MVI, and thiamine), there is no mention of oral pain medications being prescribed at discharge. The closest references are to future dietary plans, but these do not explicitly state the discharge diet order or pain medication regimen.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, treatment, and discharge plan. To determine if the fact \\'discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\' is mentioned, we need to look for relevant information in the summary. The summary mentions that the patient\\'s goal at discharge is to transition to oral intake that meets more than 75% of his nutritional needs, with a focus on advancing the diet as tolerated to regular foods, including small, frequent, high protein, nutrient dense meals and snacks. However, it does not explicitly state that the patient was discharged on a full liquid diet. Additionally, the summary does not mention oral pain medications at all. Therefore, the specific fact \\'discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed \\'Medications\\' section: Mentions D5 1/2 NS, MVI, thiamine, and electrolyte repletion, but no pain medications. 2. Checked \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' in both standard and problem based summaries: States goal to transition to oral intake meeting >75% needs and \\'regular foods\\', but does not specify \\'full liquid diet\\'. 3. Scanned entire document for \\'pain medications\\' or equivalents: No mention of analgesics in discharge medications or plan. 4. While nutritional transition is discussed, the specific discharge diet level (full liquid) and pain management medications are not explicitly stated in any section.\\n\\n\\n\\n**53. Patient 25, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Analyzing the summary step by step: 1. The summary mentions an Upper GI contrast study that showed \\'no evidence of gastric outlet obstruction\\' (in Key Diagnostic Investigations section) 2. The summary mentions famotidine was started for duodenitis (in Medications section) 3. However, the summary does not mention: Switching from famotidine to PPI BID Discussion with general GI and advanced GI Deferral of EGD/ERCP Recommendation for empiric PPI for 8 weeks Plan for possible ERCP in next few weeks While some elements of GI workup are present (Upper GI series results and famotidine), several key components of the fact are missing. Therefore, the complete fact as stated is not fully present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The important fact to look for is \\'Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\' The hospital course summary mentions that an \\'Upper GI contrast study showed no evidence of gastric outlet obstruction.\\' This matches part of the fact we are looking for. However, the summary does not explicitly mention the discussion with GI specialists or the recommendation for empiric PPI and outpatient ERCP evaluation. It does mention that famotidine was started for duodenitis, which aligns with the initiation of IV famotidine. The fact is partially mentioned but not in its entirety.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) The \\'Upper GI contrast study showed no evidence of gastric outlet obstruction\\' is explicitly stated in the Key Diagnostic Investigations section, addressing the first part of the fact. However, the summary does not mention \\'significant obstruction along the duodenum\\' or use equivalent phrasing. 2) The summary states \\'Famotidine was started\\' but does not specify the route (IV) or mention a subsequent switch to PPI BID. 3) There is no reference to discussions with GI specialists, deferral of EGD/ERCP, or recommendations for empiric PPI for 8 weeks with outpatient ERCP planning. While partial elements (famotidine initiation and absence of gastric outlet obstruction) are present, critical components of the duodenal findings, medication escalation, and specialist recommendations are missing. A physician would not consider the full fact documented based on this summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**54. Patient 25, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) on admission or its treatment with fluids. The summary details several medical issues including pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ascites, portal vein thrombosis, hypothyroidism, and malnutrition, but does not mention any kidney problems. While fluids may have been given during the hospital stay, there is no specific documentation of fluid administration for treating AKI. The diagnostic investigations section lists various tests and results but does not include any reference to kidney function or renal issues. None of the problem based summaries address kidney function or AKI as a clinical concern.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) on admission, treatment with fluids, or its resolution. The summary details the patient\\'s admission for abdominal distention due to large volume ascites, various diagnostic investigations, therapeutic procedures like paracentesis, and management of multiple conditions including pancreatic adenocarcinoma, portal vein thrombosis, and hypothyroidism. However, there is no direct mention of AKI or its treatment with fluids.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed for mention of AKI (acute kidney injury) on admission treated with fluids that resolved. The \\'Reason for Admission\\' section states abdominal distention due to ascites but does not mention AKI. The \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\' list includes portal vein thrombosis, hypothyroidism, malnutrition, and rhinovirus—no AKI. The \\'Therapeutic Procedures\\' section describes paracentesis and chemotherapy adjustments, but no fluid resuscitation for AKI. The \\'Medications\\' section includes anticoagulants, chemotherapy agents, and supportive medications (famotidine, filgrastim), but no explicit mention of fluid therapy for AKI. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' lists three active problems (cancer, thrombosis, hypothyroidism) without AKI. No sections reference AKI diagnosis, fluid treatment, or resolution. While fluid management may have occurred incidentally (e.g., with paracentesis), the specific fact of AKI on admission treated with fluids that resolved is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**55. Patient 26, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Metoprolol dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily for improved rate control; Apixaban dosage increased to 5 mg twice daily for anticoagulation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the two parts of the fact: 1. Metoprolol increase to 75mg BID: This is explicitly mentioned in multiple places: Section 7: \\'Rate control achieved with increased doses of metoprolol succinate\\' Section 8: \\'Metoprolol succinate dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily\\' Problem #1 discharge plan: \\'Continue metoprolol succinate 75 mg BID\\' 2. Apixaban increase to 5mg BID: This is NOT mentioned. In fact, the opposite is stated: Section 7: \\'reduction of apixaban dosage due to renal impairment\\' Section 8: \\'Apixaban dosage reduced due to CKD\\' Since one part of the fact is contradicted (apixaban was decreased, not increased) and both parts must be true for the entire fact to be considered present, this fact is not explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that \\'Metoprolol succinate dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily\\' in both the Standard Section Based Summary and the Problem Based Summary. This matches the fact we are looking for regarding the metoprolol dosage. However, the summary states that \\'Apixaban dosage reduced due to CKD\\' rather than \\'Apixaban dosage increased to 5 mg twice daily.\\' The reduction is mentioned in both summaries, indicating a decrease rather than an increase. Thus, only part of the fact is mentioned (regarding metoprolol), while the other part (regarding apixaban) is not only not mentioned but is actually contradicted.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states that metoprolol succinate was increased to 75 mg BID (twice daily) in both the \\'Medications\\' section and the problem based summary. However, the summary specifies that apixaban dosage was reduced due to CKD (not increased), as noted in the \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' and \\'Medications\\' sections. The fact requires both dosage increases (metoprolol and apixaban), but only the metoprolol increase is confirmed. The apixaban adjustment direction contradicts the target fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**56. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that the fact is partially present but not in the exact causal relationship suggested. Here\\'s the step by step analysis: 1. The summary mentions emesis (vomiting) as part of the admission symptoms 2. CT angiography findings are documented, showing \\'moderate narrowing of the proximal superior mesenteric artery without acute mesenteric ischemia\\' 3. However, the summary does not explicitly connect the patient\\'s emesis to chronic mesenteric ischemia or SMA stenosis 4. The summary instead attributes the patient\\'s symptoms to gastroparesis and recent gastritis, listing these as secondary diagnoses While both components (emesis and SMA stenosis) are present in the text, the specific causal relationship between them is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the specific fact we\\'re looking for is not fully present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the CT angiography showed \\'moderate narrowing of the proximal superior mesenteric artery without acute mesenteric ischemia.\\' This indicates that there is stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), which is a key component of the fact in question. However, the summary does not explicitly link the patient\\'s emesis (vomiting) to chronic mesenteric ischemia. The presence of SMA stenosis is noted, but the connection to the patient\\'s symptoms is not directly stated. Despite this, the information about SMA stenosis is present, and a clinician might infer a potential relationship between this finding and the patient\\'s symptoms.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions CT angiography showing \\'moderate narrowing of the proximal superior mesenteric artery\\' (SMA stenosis) in the Key Diagnostic Investigations section. However, the summary attributes the patient\\'s emesis to gastroparesis and dehydration in both the Reason for Admission and Problem #2 sections. While SMA stenosis is documented, there is no explicit statement linking it to the emesis as a potential cause (e.g., chronic mesenteric ischemia). The text specifically states \\'no acute mesenteric ischemia\\' but does not discuss chronic mesenteric ischemia or its relationship to symptoms. The absence of any phrasing connecting SMA stenosis to the vomiting (even as a \\'possible\\' or \\'consider\\' statement) means the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**57. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the key components of the fact we\\'re looking for: 1. Neutropenic fever Explicitly mentioned as reason for admission 2. Coagulase negative strep bacteremia While bacteremia is mentioned and blood cultures showed Gram positive cocci in clusters, the specific organism (coagulase negative strep) is not explicitly stated. The summary only mentions \\'suggesting staphylococcal infection\\' 3. PICC removal/replacement PICC line removal is mentioned (\\'PICC line removed after 48 hours\\'), but replacement is not mentioned 4. Antibiotics Treatment with antibiotics (cefepime, vancomycin, linezolid) is clearly documented While many elements are present (neutropenic fever, bacteremia, PICC removal, and antibiotic treatment), the specific organism (coagulase negative strep) is not mentioned, and PICC replacement is not documented. Since all elements must be present for the fact to be considered fully mentioned, we must conclude the specific fact is not completely present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if it explicitly mentioned that a patient admitted for neutropenic fever was found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia and was treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics. The summary indicates the patient was admitted with neutropenic fever and had bacteremia with Gram positive cocci in clusters, suggesting a staphylococcal infection. It mentions the removal of the PICC line after 48 hours of vancomycin treatment and the use of antibiotics (cefepime, vancomycin, and linezolid). However, it does not explicitly mention \\'coagulase negative strep bacteremia\\'; instead, it suggests a staphylococcal infection. The treatment included PICC removal and antibiotics, aligning partially with the fact. The discrepancy lies in the organism identified (staphylococcal vs. coagulase negative strep).\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly mentions the patient was admitted for neutropenic fever (Reason for Admission and Secondary Diagnoses). 2. Bacteremia is listed as a secondary diagnosis, with blood cultures showing Gram positive cocci in clusters (GPCs) suggestive of staphylococcal infection. However, coagulase negative staph is not explicitly identified (only \\'staphylococcal infection\\' is mentioned, which could include coagulase positive or negative species). 3. PICC removal is documented in Therapeutic Procedures, but replacement is not mentioned. 4. Antibiotic treatment with vancomycin and linezolid is clearly stated. While the clinical scenario strongly suggests coagulase negative staph bacteremia (common in line infections) and PICC management, the specific organism identification and line replacement are not explicitly documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**58. Patient 27, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the entire hospital course summary, including both the standard section based summary and problem based summary, looking for any mention of a TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) performed on 3/6/23 or any echocardiogram results showing absence of mass or vegetations. The summary includes various diagnostic tests and results, including blood cultures, CT maxillofacial scan, and CBC results, but there is no mention of any echocardiogram being performed. Neither the date 3/6/23 nor any cardiac imaging results appear anywhere in the text. The diagnostic investigations section does not list any cardiac imaging studies, and none of the problem based summaries mention cardiac evaluation or findings.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was thoroughly reviewed to determine if the fact \\'TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary is divided into sections, including a standard section based summary and a problem based summary. Neither section mentions a Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) performed on 3/6/23 or any findings related to it, such as the absence of mass or vegetations. The summary details various diagnostic investigations, including blood cultures, CT maxillofacial scan, and CBC, but does not reference a TTE on the specified date or any other date. Therefore, the fact is not present in the provided hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed for mention of a TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) performed on 3/6/23 with no evidence of mass or vegetations. The \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\' section lists blood cultures, CT maxillofacial scan, and CBC, but no TTE. The \\'Therapeutic Procedures\\' and \\'Medications\\' sections also do not reference a TTE. The Problem Based Summary sections (including bacteremia and neutropenic fever) describe blood culture findings and antibiotic therapy but do not mention cardiac imaging. No other sections (e.g., discharge summary, conclusion) include TTE results. Since the text lacks any reference to an echocardiogram, its date (3/6/23), or findings related to masses/vegetations, the fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**59. Patient 27, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step for evidence of tonsillitis, imaging, and antibiotic treatment: 1. Imaging findings: The summary mentions \\'CT maxillofacial scan revealed... mildly enlarged tonsils without abscesses\\' 2. While enlarged tonsils are noted, there is no explicit mention of tonsillitis diagnosis or tonsillar symptoms 3. Antibiotics were given (cefepime, vancomycin, linezolid), but explicitly for other reasons: Initially for neutropenic fever Later for bacteremia with gram positive cocci 4. No mention of throat pain, difficulty swallowing, or other tonsillar symptoms 5. The enlarged tonsils appear to be an incidental finding on imaging rather than a clinical focus While there are enlarged tonsils on imaging and antibiotics were given, the antibiotics were clearly attributed to other conditions. There is no explicit mention of tonsillitis diagnosis or treatment specifically for tonsillitis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. The summary mentions a CT maxillofacial scan that revealed \\'mildly enlarged tonsils without abscesses,\\' indicating some imaging related to the tonsils. However, it does not explicitly mention symptoms suggestive of tonsillitis. The patient was treated with antibiotics (vancomycin and linezolid) for bacteremia and a suspected staphylococcal infection. While the treatment with antibiotics is mentioned, it is not directly linked to tonsillitis. Therefore, the specific fact of \\'Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics\\' is not explicitly mentioned because there is no clear indication that the antibiotics were for tonsillitis or that symptoms suggestive of tonsillitis were present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions a CT maxillofacial scan showing \\'mildly enlarged tonsils without abscesses\\' (imaging finding). However, there is no explicit mention of localizing symptoms (e.g., sore throat, dysphagia) specific to tonsillitis. Antibiotics (cefepime, vancomycin, linezolid) were administered, but these were explicitly directed at bacteremia/neutropenic fever rather than tonsillitis. While tonsillar enlargement is noted, the absence of documented tonsillitis specific symptoms and lack of antibiotic treatment targeting tonsillitis (as opposed to systemic infection) means the fact is not fully addressed.\\n\\n\\n\\n**60. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary looking for any mention of: 1) bilirubin not improving despite PTBD exchange, and 2) patient/family opting for home hospice. Here\\'s my analysis: 1. While the summary mentions persistent hyperbilirubinemia and shows that a PTBD exchange was performed (14 Fr to 16 Fr drain), it does not explicitly state that bilirubin failed to improve after this procedure. 2. There is no mention anywhere in the summary about the patient or family choosing to transition to home hospice. The discharge information discusses ongoing management plans but does not indicate a transition to hospice care. While the patient clearly had serious ongoing issues (persistent biliary obstruction, hyperbilirubinemia, etc.), the specific fact about failed treatment leading to hospice choice is not explicitly stated in this summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s admission for complications related to recurrent cholangiocarcinoma, including biliary obstruction and hyperbilirubinemia. It mentions that the patient underwent a PTBD exchange procedure on 04/21. The summary highlights that despite this intervention, the patient continued to exhibit symptoms related to biliary obstruction, including hyperbilirubinemia. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' section specifically notes that the patient had persistent hyperbilirubinemia and that the discharge plan included monitoring bilirubin levels. However, it does not explicitly state that \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange.\\' The closest information is found in the \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\' and \\'Problem Based Summary\\' sections, which indicate ongoing issues with hyperbilirubinemia post PTBD exchange. The conclusion section reiterates the challenges in managing the patient\\'s condition despite therapeutic interventions. Crucially, the summary does not directly mention the patient\\'s or family\\'s decision regarding home hospice. Therefore, while the summary implies that bilirubin levels did not improve post PTBD exchange, it does not explicitly mention the patient/family opting to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly states that after PTBD exchange (performed 04/21), the patient had \\'persistent hyperbilirubinemia\\' in both the Key Diagnostic Investigations and Conclusion sections. This directly addresses the first part of the fact regarding bilirubin not improving. 2. The summary contains no mention of transitioning to home hospice in any section. The discharge plan emphasizes continued monitoring, outpatient follow up, and symptom management without any reference to hospice care. While the family was involved in care decisions (mentioned in education components), the specific decision to transition to hospice is absent. 3. Since only one component of the two part fact is present (bilirubin persistence) while the hospice transition is missing, the complete fact as stated is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**61. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the summary for each component of the fact: 1. Sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation: While the summary mentions elevated WBC (suggesting infection) and IV Zosyn for \\'infection prophylaxis\\', explicit mention of sepsis diagnosis is absent While hypotension and dehydration are mentioned, aggressive fluid resuscitation is not explicitly described 2. Delirium requiring pharmacotherapy: Delirium is mentioned multiple times as a diagnosis and ongoing issue However, the summary does not explicitly state that pharmacotherapy was required or used for delirium management 3. Urinary retention requiring urinary catheter: While low urine output is mentioned (\\'total output of 335 mL over the last three shifts\\') There is no explicit mention of urinary retention or catheter placement While some elements are partially present (infection, delirium, low urine output), the specific combination of sepsis with fluid resuscitation, delirium with pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention with catheter placement is not explicitly documented in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provided details the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, and treatment plan. To determine if the specific fact \\'Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter\\' is mentioned, we need to analyze the summary for each component of this fact. The summary mentions delirium (Problem #5) and indicates the patient was started on IV Zosyn for infection prophylaxis, which suggests antibiotic use. However, it does not explicitly mention sepsis or aggressive fluid resuscitation. There is mention of low urine output and dehydration, but no explicit mention of urinary retention or the use of a urinary catheter. Thus, while some elements are hinted at (delirium and antibiotics), the full fact as stated is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis: The summary mentions \\'possible infection\\' and use of IV Zosyn (antibiotics), but does not explicitly state \\'sepsis.\\' Fluid resuscitation is mentioned in the context of hypotension/dehydration management, not explicitly for sepsis. 2. Delirium: Explicitly listed as a secondary diagnosis with pharmacotherapy implied through \\'manage symptoms\\' and medication monitoring, meeting criteria. 3. Urinary retention: Low urine output is documented but attributed to dehydration/renal perfusion, with no mention of urinary retention or catheter use. Since 2/3 components are not clearly present (sepsis and urinary retention), the full fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**62. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, while the summary mentions the patient\\'s advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (T4) and delirium as separate conditions, it does not explicitly state that management of the cancer was deferred to an outpatient oncologist due to the son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium. The closest reference is in Problem #3 where it mentions \\'Referral to oncology for further treatment, possibly chemotherapy or radiotherapy\\' but this is presented as a general plan rather than a deferral due to specific wishes or delirium. The summary does not mention the son\\'s involvement in decision making regarding cancer management. While both the patient\\'s delirium and cancer diagnosis are documented, their relationship to treatment decision making is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides a detailed account of the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, and management plan. Under \\'Problem #3: Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (T4)\\', it is stated that the \\'Discharge Plan and Goals: Referral to oncology for further treatment, possibly chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\\' This indicates that the management of the patient\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was planned to be deferred to outpatient oncology care. Additionally, the summary mentions the patient\\'s delirium under \\'Problem #5: Delirium\\'. While the summary does not explicitly state that the deferral was \\'per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes\\', it does confirm the deferral to outpatient care and mentions delirium, thus partially supporting the fact in question.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Searched the \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' section for Problem #3 (Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma) which states \\'Referral to oncology for further treatment, possibly chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\\' 2. Reviewed all sections for mentions of decision making by family members or deferral of care. No references to patient\\'s son\\'s wishes or deferral decisions were found. 3. While delirium is listed as a diagnosis, there is no documentation linking it to oncology management decisions. 4. The summary mentions outpatient oncology referral but does not specify deferral of management decisions to outpatient team or family input influencing this decision. 5. Key elements of the fact (deferral to outpatient oncologist, son\\'s wishes, and delirium as a factor) are not explicitly stated together or individually in the context of cancer management decisions.\\n\\n\\n\\n**63. Patient 29, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, while aspiration risk and dysphagia are mentioned multiple times, and the patient was made NPO (as evidenced by medication adjustments \\'due to NPO status\\'), there is no explicit mention of the patient developing a temporary oxygen requirement due to aspiration pneumonitis. The summary mentions aspiration as a risk and a secondary diagnosis, but does not describe a specific incident of aspiration pneumonitis leading to oxygen requirements. Additionally, while Speech Language Pathology (SLP) involvement might be implied given the dysphagia management, there is no explicit mention of SLP making the patient strictly NPO. These specific details about oxygen requirement due to aspiration pneumonitis and SLP\\'s NPO order are not present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary is analyzed to determine if the fact \\'Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary is structured into standard sections and problem based summaries. Upon reviewing the sections, there is no explicit mention of the patient developing a temporary O2 requirement or being diagnosed with aspiration pneumonitis. The summary does mention \\'aspiration\\' as a secondary diagnosis and discusses aspiration risk and precautions, but it does not directly state that the patient developed a temporary O2 requirement due to aspiration pneumonitis. Additionally, the summary indicates the patient was made NPO (nothing by mouth) status, which is consistent with the fact, but it does not specify that this was done by a Speech Language Pathologist (SLP). The PEG tube placement is mentioned, which implies a response to dysphagia and possibly aspiration risk, but the specific details about the temporary O2 requirement and the role of SLP are not found.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'aspiration\\' as a secondary diagnosis and discusses aspiration risk management, including PEG tube placement for dysphagia. However, there is no explicit mention of a temporary oxygen requirement attributed to aspiration pneumonitis. While the summary notes aspiration risk and dysphagia management (including PEG, which implies NPO status), it does not state that the patient required temporary oxygen or that SLP enforced strict NPO. The absence of these specific elements means the fact is not confirmed as explicitly documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n### B.

All Inconsistent Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 0, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left-sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states a left sided abdominal JP drain was left at discharge. 2. The Hospital Course Summary details multiple aspects of postoperative care (pain management, diet, medications) but never mentions placement or presence of a JP drain. 3. Key sections like \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' and \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge\\' would typically document drain management if applicable. 4. The absence of any reference to a JP drain in the summary directly conflicts with the stated fact about drain presence at discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 0, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Discharged with DVT prophylaxis, with anemia at hemoglobin 8.8\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'Discharged with DVT prophylaxis\\' which is not mentioned in the Hospital Course Summary. 2. Summary\\'s \\'Medications\\' section lists postoperative drugs (epidural, octreotide) but no anticoagulants or mechanical DVT prevention measures. 3. Discharge plans in both Problem #1 and #3 sections lack any reference to DVT prophylaxis. 4. While hemoglobin 8.8 is confirmed in both documents, the absence of DVT prophylaxis documentation in the summary directly conflicts with the stated fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 1, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** R chest tube was placed with drainage; intrapleural alteplase given; chest tube removed\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'chest tube removed\\' but the Hospital Course Summary does not mention chest tube removal. 2. Summary\\'s Therapeutic Procedures section only documents chest tube and alteplase administration. 3. Problem #5 (Pericardial Effusion) states \\'managed with chest tube and alteplase\\' at discharge, implying ongoing use. 4. No explicit documentation of removal creates inconsistency with the fact\\'s assertion of removal.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 3, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** R-sided chest pain 2/2 port-associated thrombus\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states R sided chest pain is secondary to port associated thrombus (2/2). 2. The Hospital Summary lists \\'Right sided chest pain\\' and \\'non occlusive thrombus around the right port catheter\\' as separate secondary diagnoses (Section 5). 3. In the Problem Based Summary, R sided chest pain (Problem #2) and the thrombus (Problem #4) are addressed independently without causal linkage. 4. No part of the summary attributes the chest pain to the thrombus, creating a direct contradiction since the fact and summary cannot both be true if causation is unacknowledged.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 4, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pancreatic tail mass leading to outpatient GI biopsy\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states that the patient was admitted with a pancreatic mass requiring oncology evaluation, and the discharge plan includes \\'Expedited biopsy and oncology follow up\\' 2. The summary lists \\'Awaiting biopsy results\\' as a pending issue 3. This indicates the biopsy has not yet been performed, which contradicts the fact stating there was an outpatient GI biopsy 4. The summary clearly shows the biopsy is planned for the future rather than having already occurred in an outpatient setting\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was admitted due to an adrenal crisis secondary to primary adrenal insufficiency and was already on Prednisone 2.5 mg twice daily. The summary does not mention any issues with intolerance to PO prednisone; instead, it states she was continued on Prednisone and Fludrocortisone. The Important Fact suggests that the adrenal crisis was likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone, which is not supported or mentioned in the summary. Therefore, the summary does not confirm the intolerance to PO prednisone as the cause of the adrenal crisis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states adrenal crisis was \\'likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone.\\' 2. Hospital Summary lists Prednisone 2.5 mg BID as part of her continued medications (Section Based Summary #8), with no documented discontinuation or adverse reaction. 3. Continued use of prednisone without adjustment contradicts the assertion of intolerance caused the crisis. Both cannot be true simultaneously.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions insulin was adjusted from 5 units/hr to 16 units BID of Levemir (not Lantus) 2. The summary indicates a different insulin regimen than the fact states (Lantus 15 units BID) 3. While both describe twice daily insulin dosing, the specific insulin type and dose are different (Levemir 16 units vs Lantus 15 units) 4. These differences in both insulin type and dosage amount constitute a clear contradiction\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states insulin changed to Lantus 15 units BID. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s Medications section specifies \\'16 units BID (Levemir)\\'. 3. Levemir (insulin detemir) and Lantus (insulin glargine) are different long acting insulins. 4. Both dose (16 vs 15) and insulin type (Levemir vs Lantus) conflict between sources.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 6, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Vitamin D deficiency, started on replacement, fat soluble vitamins sent, need to follow-up \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states vitamin D deficiency was addressed with replacement started and fat soluble vitamins sent. 2. Hospital summary lists B12 supplementation (water soluble) under medications but no mention of vitamin D replacement or fat soluble vitamins. 3. Malabsorption syndrome evaluation pending (Problem #3) but no documentation of fat soluble vitamin replacement being initiated. 4. Summary\\'s therapeutic procedures and medications sections lack evidence of vitamin D management as per the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows the patient is still hospitalized and receiving Zosyn, while the fact states they are being discharged on Cipro. 2. The summary mentions nothing about a 7 day course of Cipro. 3. While both mention finasteride initiation, they differ on the current antibiotic therapy. 4. The summary indicates the patient is still receiving active treatment for the infection (\\'continues to experience burning on urination\\' and \\'remains hospitalized\\'), while the fact suggests the treatment course is completing. 5. These details represent clear contradictions in the treatment course and timing.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient was finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge for sepsis from a urinary source with potential pyelonephritis and was started on finasteride to prevent future UTIs. The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient was treated with Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam) for a complicated urinary tract infection with Klebsiella species and possible pyelonephritis, leading to sepsis. It also mentions that finasteride was initiated during the hospital stay for prostatomegaly. However, there is no mention of cipro being prescribed or continued at discharge in the Hospital Course Summary. The discharge plan for the complicated urinary tract infection involves continuing Zosyn and monitoring urine culture sensitivities, not cipro. Thus, the summary contradicts the fact regarding the antibiotic being continued at discharge.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states patient was \\'finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge,\\' but the Hospital Summary documents Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam) as the antibiotic used, with the patient still hospitalized and no mention of cipro. 2. Important Fact claims finasteride was started \\'to prevent future UTIs,\\' but the Summary explicitly states finasteride was initiated \\'for prostatomegaly.\\' These are irreconcilable differences in antibiotic choice and medication indication.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 9, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling, DVT US negative, unclear etiology \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'Right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling\\' while the summary describes \\'Right lower extremity (RLE) and left lower extremity (LLE) swelling\\' 2. The Important Fact mentions \\'DVT US negative\\' while the summary states \\'Awaiting ultrasound results to determine the cause of swelling\\' 3. The locations of swelling are different (upper vs lower extremity) and the ultrasound status differs (completed vs pending), making these accounts contradictory\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact mentions \\'Right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling, DVT US negative, unclear etiology\\'. The Hospital Course Summary under \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\' and \\'Problem #6\\' mentions \\'Right lower extremity (RLE) and left lower extremity (LLE) swelling\\', indicating swelling in different extremities than stated in the Important Fact. The summary does mention LLE swelling, consistent with the Important Fact, but states RLE swelling instead of right upper extremity swelling. Thus, there is a contradiction regarding the extremity involved.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'Right upper extremity\\' swelling, but Hospital Summary lists \\'Right lower extremity (RLE)\\' swelling in Problem #6. 2. Important Fact reports \\'DVT US negative\\', but Hospital Summary states \\'Awaiting ultrasound results\\' for extremity swelling in Problem #6\\'s Outstanding Issues. 3. These discrepancies in affected extremities and DVT assessment status create direct contradictions.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 12, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient sent to the hospital from home for symptoms of tachycardia, hypotension, found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula\\n\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states the patient was found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s \\'Relevant Surgical History\\' explicitly states the fistula was formed\\' as a result of their previous HIPEC procedure. 3. This indicates the fistula was a pre existing complication of prior surgery, not a new finding during this admission. 4. Therefore, the summary directly contradicts the claim of a \\'new\\' fistula.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 12, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was started on empiric antibiotics but was found to have a normal WBC with normal lactate and abx were discontinued, he was not discharged on antibiotics\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions \\'elevated white blood cell count (WBC)\\' in the diagnostic investigations section. 2. This directly contradicts the fact stating \\'normal WBC\\'. 3. The summary also does not mention the discontinuation of antibiotics that is stated in the fact. 4. While the antibiotic discontinuation could be an omission, the explicit mention of elevated WBC creates a clear contradiction with the fact stating normal WBC.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states WBC was normal, leading to antibiotic discontinuation. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\' explicitly reports elevated WBC. 3. These WBC findings (normal vs elevated) are mutually exclusive. 4. No mention of antibiotic initiation/discontinuation in summary doesn\\'t resolve the direct lab value conflict.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions several complications and issues during the hospital course: Poorly controlled diabetes requiring insulin adjustment Elevated blood pressure, particularly in evening Skin reaction with blistering on coccyx Complex management of multiple comorbidities 2. This directly contradicts the statement that the post operative course was \\'unremarkable\\' 3. While the patient was ultimately discharged home in stable condition, the multiple complications and management challenges make this a remarkable rather than unremarkable course\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient was admitted for bilateral mastectomy with an unremarkable post operative course and discharge home. The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient underwent bilateral complete mastectomy and right axillary lymph node dissection. However, it also mentions that the patient had \\'poorly controlled diabetes with elevated glucose levels\\' and \\'elevated blood pressure noted, particularly in the evening\\', indicating that the post operative course was not entirely unremarkable. Additionally, the summary notes a \\'skin reaction to adhesive\\' as one of the problems, which further suggests that the post operative course was complicated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'unremarkable post operative course\\', but the Hospital Course Summary documents multiple complications: poorly controlled diabetes requiring insulin adjustments (glucose 195 207 mg/dL), elevated blood pressure needing monitoring, and a skin reaction with blistering requiring wound care consultation. 2. These complications (diabetes management issues, hypertension, skin reaction) contradict the assertion of an unremarkable recovery. 3. The conclusion states her postoperative course was \\'complicated by poorly controlled diabetes\\', directly conflicting with \\'unremarkable\\' status.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary directly contradicts the fact by stating her diabetes was poorly controlled during the hospital stay: \\'Glucose readings were consistently elevated, indicating poorly controlled diabetes\\' \\'Problem #2: Diabetes Mellitus Current Clinical Status: Poorly controlled diabetes with elevated glucose levels\\' Progress notes show elevated glucose readings of 195, 207, and 162 mg/dL 2. The fact states DM2 was not worsened perioperatively, but the summary clearly indicates it was worse than baseline requiring insulin sliding scale adjustments\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient\\'s chronic medical conditions, including DM2, were not worsened perioperatively. The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient\\'s diabetes mellitus (DM2) was \\'poorly controlled with elevated glucose levels\\' during the hospital stay. This information directly contradicts the Important Fact because \\'poorly controlled\\' diabetes implies a worsening of the condition perioperatively.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 14, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bevacizumab was initiated during hospitalization\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary provides a detailed list of all medications and therapeutic procedures in sections 7 and 8 2. Bevacizumab is not mentioned anywhere in the hospital course summary 3. The summary thoroughly documents all treatments initiated during hospitalization, including dexamethasone, enoxaparin, and other medications 4. Since the summary appears comprehensive in documenting new medication starts, and bevacizumab is not mentioned, this indicates it was not initiated during the hospitalization\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The \\'Medications\\' section lists all drugs administered during hospitalization. 2. Bevacizumab is not mentioned in any medications or therapeutic procedures. 3. The conclusion specifically states dexamethasone therapy was initiated, with no reference to bevacizumab. 4. Both sections would document new medication initiation if it occurred.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The hospital course summary clearly states the primary diagnosis as \\'acute kidney injury (AKI) superimposed on chronic heart failure (HFrEF) and pre existing end stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to lupus nephritis\\' 2. This directly contradicts the provided important fact stating the principal diagnosis at discharge was \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' 3. Furthermore, while the patient had nausea and vomiting, these were listed only as secondary diagnoses, and nowhere in the summary is viral gastroenteritis mentioned as a diagnosis\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the primary diagnosis is acute kidney injury (AKI) superimposed on chronic heart failure (HFrEF) and pre existing end stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to lupus nephritis. The Important Fact states that the principal diagnosis at discharge was viral gastroenteritis. The summary does not mention viral gastroenteritis as a diagnosis or discharge diagnosis. The presence of nausea and vomiting is mentioned, but it is attributed to AKI and not viral gastroenteritis. Therefore, the summary contradicts the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the principal diagnosis at discharge is viral gastroenteritis. 2. The Hospital Course Summary lists \\'acute kidney injury (AKI) superimposed on chronic heart failure and ESRD\\' as the Primary Diagnosis (Standard Section 4). 3. Secondary diagnoses include nausea/vomiting but do not mention viral gastroenteritis (Standard Section 5). 4. The Problem Based Summary and Conclusion focus on AKI management without referencing viral gastroenteritis. 5. Viral gastroenteritis is never mentioned in either diagnosis section, while AKI is explicitly stated as the primary focus.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 15, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily stopped when the patient initially came to the hospital.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily stopped when the patient initially came to the hospital. The Hospital Course Summary indicates that tacrolimus was discontinued due to concerns about AKI and HFrEF, and mycophenolate and prednisone were actually administered as new medications. This shows that while tacrolimus was stopped, mycophenolate and prednisone were not, contradicting the Important Fact that all three were temporarily stopped.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, prednisone) were temporarily stopped at admission. 2. The Hospital Summary (Standard Section 7 8) explicitly lists \\'discontinuation of tacrolimus\\' but paradoxically includes mycophenolate and prednisone under \\'new medications administered/sent to pharmacy\\'. 3. This creates a direct contradiction: mycophenolate and prednisone cannot be both stopped (per fact) and newly administered (per summary) simultaneously.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 16, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Currently on high dose dexamethasone and Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The \\'Important Fact\\' states that the patient is currently on high dose dexamethasone and Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis. The Hospital Course Summary under \\'Medications\\' mentions that \\'dexamethasone was initiated for edema management\\', indicating the patient is on dexamethasone. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' under \\'Brain Metastases with Vasogenic Edema\\' states \\'continuation of high dose steroids\\' as part of the discharge plan, confirming the patient is on high dose dexamethasone. However, there is no mention of \\'Bactrim\\' in the Hospital Course Summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the patient is on Bactrim for PJP prophylaxis. 2. The Hospital Summary\\'s \\'Medications\\' section lists dexamethasone, anastrozole, acetaminophen, and ondansetron, but does not mention Bactrim. 3. High dose dexamethasone use (as documented) typically requires PJP prophylaxis with Bactrim, making its absence in the summary a direct contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 17, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Delirium tremens requiring intravenous benzodiazepines and phenobarbital for symptom control\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states delirium tremens required IV benzodiazepines and phenobarbital. 2. Summary lists phenobarbital use but only PRN lorazepam (a benzodiazepine), not continuous IV benzodiazepines. 3. Summary diagnoses \\'acute ethanol withdrawal syndrome with perceptual disturbance\\' but does not mention delirium tremens (a more severe form of withdrawal). 4. CIWA protocol use suggests standard withdrawal management rather than DT specific treatment. These elements create a contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions persistent fever with negative infectious workup (blood cultures showed no growth, urinalysis negative for infection) 2. No pulmonary infection is mentioned or suspected in the summary 3. The fever is attributed to other causes specifically neutropenic fever and CNS lymphoma involvement 4. The infectious workup results align with the fact, but the suspected cause differs (pulmonary vs. neutropenic/CNS lymphoma) 5. Therefore, while the fever is persistent, the suspected etiology in the summary contradicts the fact\\'s assumption of pulmonary infection\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary states \\'fever of unknown origin, likely secondary to neutropenic fever and CNS lymphoma involvement\\' (Reason for Admission). 2. Key diagnostic results include \\'blood cultures showed no growth, and urinalysis was negative for infection\\', supporting non infectious etiology. 3. The conclusion explicitly states \\'absence of growth in blood cultures and negative urinalysis suggested a non infectious etiology for the fever\\'. 4. The fact claims \\'suspected pulmonary infection\\' despite negative workups, but the summary attributes fever to lymphoma/neutropenia without mentioning pulmonary infection suspicion, creating a direct contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 18, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma recently complicated by progression to CNS lymphoma\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)\\' as the diagnosis. 2. The Hospital Summary lists \\'High grade B cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 translocations\\' as the Primary Diagnosis. 3. High grade B cell lymphoma with MYC/BCL2 translocations (double hit lymphoma) is a distinct entity from DLBCL in current WHO classifications. 4. These are mutually exclusive diagnostic categories, making the summary\\'s diagnosis incompatible with the DLBCL claim in the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\' implying platelet decline after starting steroids. 2. Hospital summary documents \\'progressive thrombocytopenia\\' as admission reason but later states \\'Current Clinical Status: Stable with prednisone therapy\\' for thrombocytopenia. 3. No documentation of platelet count worsening after prednisone initiation; discharge platelet related plans focus on monitoring without mentioning new declines. 4. Summary describes thrombocytopenia as stabilized under prednisone management, conflicting with the fact\\'s claim of post prednisone worsening.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary does not indicate recurrent falls during the hospital stay or an extensive inpatient workup for falls. 2. The summary mentions a single fall at home that led to admission with a clear etiology (T6 compression fracture). 3. While the patient has a history of falls noted in their medical history, these are attributed to \\'gait instability and hesitancy in using a walker\\' not unknown etiology. 4. The summary describes specific interventions for fall prevention (TLSO brace, discontinuation of gabapentin) rather than an extensive workup for unexplained falls. 5. The discharge plan includes rehabilitation and fall prevention strategies, suggesting the falls are considered related to known physical limitations rather than unknown causes.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\'. 2. Hospital Course Summary attributes falls to \\'gait instability and hesitancy in using a walker\\' (Standard Summary) and \\'gait instability\\' (Improved Summary). 3. Identification of gait instability as a cause directly contradicts the \\'unknown etiology\\' claim in the Important Fact. 4. Both documents cannot be true simultaneously regarding fall etiology.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states the T6 wedge compression fracture occurred following a recent fall at home. 2. The fracture is described as \\'subacute\\' in the Primary Diagnosis section, which could be consistent with an older injury. 3. However, the summary directly links the fracture to the current admission\\'s fall (\\'admitted following a fall at home, which resulted in a closed wedge compression fracture\\'). 4. This contradicts the Important Fact stating the fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall\\'. 5. Since both statements cannot be true (fracture caused by current fall vs. predating current fall), there is a clear contradiction.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that the patient, Selma Toosi, was admitted following a fall at home, which resulted in a closed wedge compression fracture of the T6 vertebra. The Important Fact states that the T6 wedge compression fracture likely happened before the most recent fall. The summary and the fact cannot both be true because the summary directly links the T6 fracture to the fall at admission, contradicting the fact that it likely occurred before the fall.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital summary states the T6 fracture was caused by the recent fall (Reason for Admission). 2. The diagnosis is labeled \\'subacute,\\' indicating the fracture occurred weeks prior. 3. These two statements conflict because a subacute fracture cannot be caused by the same admission triggering fall.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 22, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary describes a biliary drain exchange during this admission due to infection (purulent drainage, cholangitis) 2. The summary shows this was an active infection requiring treatment, not a post procedural complication 3. There is no mention of a recent prior biliary stent exchange that led to cholangitis 4. The timeline and causation in the Important Fact (post procedural cholangitis following recent stent exchange) contradicts the presentation described in the summary (patient admitted with active infection requiring drain exchange)\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'Post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\' (implying cholangitis occurred AFTER the procedure). 2. Hospital Summary Problem #3 states \\'Improvement noted WITH the biliary drain exchange procedure\\' for cholangitis, indicating cholangitis was present BEFORE/PRIOR to the procedure. 3. These two statements are mutually exclusive the summary describes cholangitis as being treated by the procedure, while the fact claims it was caused by the procedure.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the need to \\'continue and re eval further Augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion.\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary explicitly lists empiric Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) as the antibiotic used, not Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate). 3. No mention of Augmentin therapy initiation, continuation, or re evaluation appears in any section of the summary. 4. The sepsis discharge plan only states \\'Continue antibiotic therapy as needed,\\' without specifying Augmentin. 5. This creates a direct contradiction, as the summary documents a different antibiotic regimen than what the Important Fact prescribes.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 23, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** large pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'large pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis\\' (implying persistent effusion post procedure). 2. Hospital Summary explicitly states \\'Pleural Effusion: Resolved post thoracentesis\\' in Problem #3. 3. These statements are mutually exclusive a resolved effusion cannot coexist with a large post thoracentesis effusion.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 23, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact mentions that Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR and a likely new clinical trial drug in 4/2023. The Hospital Course Summary does not mention any plans for transcatheter MVR or discussion of a new clinical trial drug in 4/2023. The summary does mention follow up with a cardiologist under \\'Problem #1: Heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)\\' but lacks specifics about transcatheter MVR or a new clinical trial drug.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states Cardiology will coordinate follow up with the Heart Failure team for transcatheter MVR and a clinical trial drug (4/2023). 2. The Hospital Course Summary\\'s discharge plans (Problem #1 HFpEF) only specify \\'follow up with a cardiologist\\' without mentioning the Heart Failure team, transcatheter MVR, or clinical trial drug. 3. The summary explicitly lists \\'transition to duvelisib\\' as the medication change but does not reference any new clinical trial drug related to MVR in 2023. 4. These omissions create a direct contradiction since the Important Fact\\'s specific follow up plan is absent in the documented discharge instructions.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 24, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** this (and prior) small bowel obstruction managed nonoperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary indicates nonoperative management of the current SBO through: NGT placement NPO status Enteral nutrition via NJ tube 2. The summary mentions \\'multiple prior small bowel obstructions\\' and states the patient\\'s history includes \\'multiple surgeries for small bowel obstructions\\' 3. While the current episode is being managed nonoperatively, the mention of previous surgeries for SBOs means not all prior episodes were managed nonoperatively 4. This contradicts the fact stating \\'this (and prior) small bowel obstruction managed nonoperatively\\'\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The \\'Important Fact\\' states that the current and prior small bowel obstruction was managed nonoperatively. The \\'Hospital Course Summary\\' indicates that the patient has a history of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and has undergone \\'multiple surgeries for small bowel obstructions\\' under \\'Relevant Surgical History\\'. This information directly contradicts the \\'Important Fact\\' because it implies that at least some of the prior small bowel obstructions were managed operatively, not nonoperatively.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states both current and prior SBOs were managed nonoperatively. 2. The Hospital Summary\\'s \\'Relevant Surgical History\\' explicitly states \\'multiple surgeries for small bowel obstructions.\\' 3. Surgical management of prior SBOs directly contradicts the nonoperative management claim in the Important Fact. 4. Current admission used NJ tube/enteral nutrition (nonoperative), but prior surgical interventions create irreconcilable conflict with the fact statement.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 24, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary indicates the patient is being fed via nasojejunal (NJ) tube with enteral nutrition at discharge, not on a full liquid diet 2. The discharge plan mentions a \\'goal to transition\\' to oral intake, indicating this hasn\\'t happened yet 3. The summary discusses \\'continued monitoring of the patient\\'s tolerance to oral intake\\' as an outstanding issue, suggesting oral intake hasn\\'t been established 4. There is no mention of oral pain medications at discharge 5. The patient\\'s current status shows active management of SBO with enteral nutrition support, which contradicts being on a full liquid diet\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was being managed with enteral nutrition support via a nasojejunal (NJ) tube and that the goal at discharge was to transition to oral intake that meets more than 75% of his nutritional needs. It does not explicitly state that the patient was discharged on a full liquid diet and oral pain medications. The discharge plan mentions advancing the diet as tolerated to regular foods, focusing on small, frequent, high protein, nutrient dense meals and snacks, which contradicts the fact that the patient was discharged on a full liquid diet. Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the patient was \\'discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\'. 2. The Hospital Summary\\'s Discharge Plan under Problem #1 specifies the goal is to \\'advance the diet as tolerated to regular foods\\', not a liquid diet. 3. Enteral nutrition via NJ tube was still being used at discharge (\\'Current Clinical Status\\' for SBO), indicating oral intake was not yet primary. 4. No mention of oral pain medications being prescribed at discharge in the Medications section or discharge plans. 5. The summary\\'s focus on transitioning to oral intake (75% goal) contradicts immediate discharge on full liquid diet while NJ tube feeds continue.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 25, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states the patient was switched from IV famotidine to PPI BID. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s Medications section lists famotidine initiation but does not mention PPI. 3. Omission of PPI in discharge medications contradicts the fact\\'s explicit medication change. 4. Summary\\'s silence on GI specialist recommendations (empiric PPI for 8 weeks) doesn\\'t conflict, but active medication discrepancy does.\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 25, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states AKI was present on admission and treated with fluids, which resolved. 2. The Hospital Course Summary does not mention AKI in the Reason for Admission, Primary/Secondary Diagnoses, Therapeutic Procedures, Medications, or Problem Based Summary. 3. No documentation of AKI management (e.g., fluid administration) or resolution. 4. Absence of AKI related information in the assertion creates a direct contradiction, as resolved AKI would typically be documented in discharge summaries.\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 26, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Metoprolol dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily for improved rate control; Apixaban dosage increased to 5 mg twice daily for anticoagulation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states that apixaban dosage was reduced due to CKD, while the Important Fact states it was increased to 5 mg twice daily. 2. This is a direct contradiction as both statements cannot be true simultaneously the medication cannot be both increased and decreased. 3. The metoprolol dosage increase to 75 mg twice daily mentioned in both the Important Fact and summary is consistent.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that metoprolol succinate dosage was increased to 75 mg twice daily, which is consistent with the Important Fact. However, it also mentions that apixaban dosage was \\'reduced due to CKD\\', which contradicts the Important Fact that states apixaban dosage was increased to 5 mg twice daily.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states apixaban dosage was increased to 5 mg twice daily. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s \\'Medications\\' section explicitly states \\'Apixaban dosage reduced due to CKD\\'. 3. These two statements directly contradict each other regarding apixaban dosage direction (increase vs reduction).\\n\\n\\n\\n**34. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia due to SMA stenosis. 2. Summary\\'s Key Diagnostic Results note \\'moderate narrowing of proximal SMA\\' but explicitly state \\'no acute mesenteric ischemia\\'. 3. Problem Based Summary attributes vomiting to gastroparesis/dehydration without mentioning SMA stenosis as a contributor. 4. Chronic mesenteric ischemia (from SMA stenosis) and gastroparesis are distinct etiologies; summary\\'s attribution to gastroparesis directly conflicts with the Important Fact\\'s proposed mechanism.\\n\\n\\n\\n**35. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows blood cultures grew Gram positive cocci in clusters (GPCs), suggesting staphylococcal infection, while the fact states it was coagulase negative strep bacteremia this is a clear contradiction. 2. The summary mentions PICC line removal after 48 hours of treatment but doesn\\'t mention replacement, while the fact specifically mentions PICC removal AND replacement. 3. The difference in bacterial identification (staph vs. strep) is clinically significant and represents a clear inconsistency between the two accounts.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient was admitted for neutropenic fever and found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia. The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient was admitted with neutropenic fever following induction chemotherapy for AML. Under \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\', it is stated that \\'Blood cultures grew Gram positive cocci in clusters (GPCs) from two sets, suggesting a possible staphylococcal infection.\\' Coagulase negative strep bacteremia is not consistent with the summary\\'s indication of a staphylococcal infection (Gram positive cocci in clusters). Thus, the summary contradicts the Important Fact regarding the type of bacteremia.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states bacteremia was due to coagulase negative strep, but Hospital Summary describes blood cultures with Gram positive cocci in clusters (staphylococcal pattern, not streptococcal). 2. Summary mentions PICC removal but no replacement, conflicting with Fact\\'s \\'removal/replacement\\' treatment.\\n\\n\\n\\n**36. Patient 27, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions \\'mildly enlarged tonsils\\' on CT maxillofacial scan, but does not indicate tonsillitis as a diagnosis. 2. The antibiotics mentioned (cefepime, vancomycin, linezolid) were specifically given for bacteremia with Gram positive cocci, not for tonsillitis. 3. The localizing symptoms suggestive of tonsillitis mentioned in the Important Fact are not described in the summary. 4. The summary attributes the fever to neutropenia and bacteremia, not to tonsillitis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'suggestive of tonsilitis\\' treated with antibiotics. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s CT scan shows \\'mildly enlarged tonsils without abscesses\\' but does not diagnose tonsilitis. 3. Antibiotics (cefepime/vancomycin/linezolid) were used for bacteremia/neutropenic fever, not explicitly for tonsilitis. 4. No mention of tonsilitis in diagnoses or problem lists. 5. Enlarged tonsils on imaging without clinical diagnosis creates contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**37. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange. The Summary\\'s \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\' notes \\'persistent hyperbilirubinemia\\' post PTBD, aligning with this. 2. However, the Summary\\'s discharge plan (Conclusion) describes ongoing monitoring and outpatient follow up, with no mention of transition to home hospice as stated in the Fact. These discharge plans (e.g., \\'continue PTBD drain\\', \\'regular diet\\') conflict directly with hospice care, which focuses on comfort rather than active management.\\n\\n\\n\\n**38. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the hospital course was complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter. The Hospital Course Summary mentions delirium (Problem #5) and indicates that the patient was managed for it, but does not explicitly state that pharmacotherapy was used. The summary does mention that the patient was started on IV Zosyn for infection prophylaxis, which could be considered as antibiotics, but it does not confirm sepsis or aggressive fluid resuscitation. There is no mention of urinary retention or the use of a urinary catheter in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states sepsis required antibiotics; summary mentions IV Zosyn for infection prophylaxis (prevention, not treatment) and elevated WBC suggesting possible infection, but no explicit sepsis diagnosis or treatment. 2. Important Fact cites urinary retention requiring catheter; summary documents low urine output but no mention of urinary retention diagnosis or catheter placement. 3. Delirium pharmacotherapy in Important Fact vs. summary\\'s generic \\'manage symptoms\\' without specific medications. These specific omissions/conflicts make both versions mutually exclusive.\\n\\n\\n\\n**39. Patient 29, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt w/ metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma admitted for dysphagia and weight loss treated w/ PEG and tube feeding and strict NPO.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states the patient was treated with PEG and strict NPO (nothing by mouth). 2. Summary confirms PEG placement and tube feeding (Osmolite, bolus regimen), aligning with NPO. 3. However, Problem #8 (Swallowing Dysfunction) lists \\'adjust diet as needed\\' and \\'modified diet\\' in discharge plans, which conflicts with strict NPO. 4. Strict NPO prohibits all oral intake, making diet adjustments incompatible.\\n\\n\\n\\n**40. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was referred to oncology for further treatment of his advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, as seen in Problem #3: Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (T4). This contradicts the Important Fact that management of the patient\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was deferred to an outpatient oncologist per the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and the patient\\'s delirium. The summary suggests active planning for cancer treatment, not deferral.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma was deferred to outpatient oncologist due to patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and delirium. 2. Hospital Summary under Problem #3 states discharge plan includes \\'Referral to oncology for further treatment, possibly chemotherapy or radiotherapy\\'. 3. Active referral for treatment contradicts deferral of management decision making to outpatient team per family wishes.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'gpt-4o': '# Factual evaluation of the gpt-4o summarizer by a LLM jury\\n\\n## Jury members: claude-3.5-sonnet-v2, llama4-maverick, deepseek-r1\\n\\n## Main results\\n\\n### A. Presence of important facts\\n\\n**Score: 65/100** (95% CI: 55-74) (higher values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the important facts missing:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries frequently omit critical clinical facts due to recurring patterns: (1) **Incomplete procedural documentation** (e.g., Patient 0’s left JP drain omitted despite right drain removal), (2) **assumption of implied outcomes** without explicit confirmation (e.g., Patient 2’s bowel recovery inferred from regimens but flatus/bowel movements unstated), (3) **pending actions reported as incomplete** (e.g., Patient 4’s outpatient biopsy planned but not executed), (4) **medication specifics lacking** (e.g., Patient 6’s Lantus dose change and vitamin D follow-up absent), (5) **causal relationships unlinked** (e.g., Patient 6’s adrenal crisis not tied to prednisone intolerance), (6) **acute events undocumented** (e.g., Patient 13’s panic attack missing despite mental health history), and (7) **diagnostic ambiguity unresolved** (e.g., Patient 15’s AKI attributed to nausea/vomiting without viral gastroenteritis confirmation). Additionally, **discharge details** often lack specificity (e.g., Patient 12’s TPN follow-up timeframe omitted) or misrepresent management rationale (e.g., Patient 28’s hospice transition not linked to bilirubin trends). These omissions reflect systemic gaps in synthesizing multidisciplinary data, documenting temporal relationships, and specifying post-discharge plans.\\n\\n### B. Hospital course summaries contradicting important facts\\n\\n**Score: 10/100** (95% CI: 4-16) (lower values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the inconsistencies:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries frequently exhibit inconsistencies with clinical facts due to recurring patterns: **omission of critical findings** (Patient 8: missing aspiration event and pending blood culture speciation), **contradictory documentation** (Patient 13: \"remarkable\" vs. \"unremarkable\" postoperative course; Patient 8: AKI vs. viral gastroenteritis as principal diagnosis), **medication discrepancies** (Patient 9: ciprofloxacin course omitted in favor of vancomycin/Zosyn; Patient 26: \"continued\" vs. \"increased\" apixaban dosing), **terminology conflicts** (Patient 28: \"reducing hyperbilirubinemia\" vs. \"no improvement\" post-PTBD), and **misattribution of clinical findings** (Patient 26: SMA stenosis noted but emesis attributed to gastroparesis, not ischemia). These errors often arise from incomplete data synthesis (e.g., pending cultures in Patient 8), inconsistent terminology (e.g., Patient 13’s DM2 exacerbation requiring insulin omitted), and failure to reconcile diagnostic conclusions with documented evidence (e.g., Patient 15’s AKI prioritized over viral gastroenteritis). Specific examples include Patient 18’s resolved fever contradicting \"persistent\" claims and Patient 28’s bilirubin decline conflicting with stated lack of improvement.\\n\\n## Detailed results\\n\\n### A.

All Missing Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 0, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left-sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I searched for any mention of a left sided abdominal JP drain or its status at discharge. While the summary does mention drain management (specifically noting the removal of the right JP drain with low amylase output on 11/16/2023), there is no explicit mention of a left sided JP drain or its presence at discharge. The summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s discharge status and various aspects of care, but does not include any information about a left sided drain being present at discharge. Even in the detailed discharge planning sections and problem based summary format, this specific detail is not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, treatment, and discharge plan. To determine if the fact \\'Left sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\' is mentioned, we need to review the sections related to surgical interventions and the patient\\'s condition at discharge. The summary mentions that the patient underwent a Whipple procedure and had a right JP drain removed on 11/16/2023. However, it does not explicitly state the presence or status of a left sided abdominal JP drain at the time of discharge. The information about JP drains is found under \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed,\\' which only mentions the removal of the right JP drain. There is no mention of a left sided JP drain being left in place or its status at discharge.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'Removal of the right JP drain with low amylase output on 11/16/2023\\' under Therapeutic Procedures Performed. However, there is no mention of a left sided JP drain being present or left in place at discharge. The discharge condition section and problem based summaries do not reference any remaining drains. The removal of the right JP drain is documented, but the left sided drain is not described in any context (placement, presence, or removal). Since the fact specifically refers to a left sided drain being left at discharge, and the text only addresses the right JP drain, the required fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 2, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed. Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, while it mentions that a \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' was performed on 5/19 (under section 7: Therapeutic Procedures Performed), it does not explicitly mention the specific details about taking down adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall, nor does it specifically describe removing obstructing necrotic mass in those exact terms. While the summary does mention a \\'necrotic mass\\' in the CT findings and indicates that surgery was performed, the specific surgical details about adhesions and the exact manner of mass removal are not explicitly described. The summary provides a more general description of the procedure without these specific operative details.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 2, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient recovered from surgery well; had flatus and bowel movement \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, while the summary indicates the patient had a successful laparoscopic small bowel resection and shows general improvement (\\'progressive postoperative recovery\\'), it does not explicitly mention the patient having flatus or a bowel movement. The closest references are: 1) Under medications, there is mention of a \\'standard postoperative bowel regimen\\' and bowel medications (Miralax, Senna), 2) Under Problem #2, it notes \\'Post operatively, nausea and vomiting controlled\\' and \\'gradually advance diet as tolerated\\', and 3) Under Problem #7, it mentions \\'Advanced to post surgical diet.\\' However, none of these explicitly state the patient had flatus or a bowel movement. While these might suggest normal bowel function was returning, we cannot definitively say the specific fact is mentioned without making assumptions.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient underwent \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis performed on 5/19; no acute postoperative complications.\\' It further details the patient\\'s recovery under \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge\\' and \\'Problem Based Summary\\', indicating that the patient\\'s nausea and vomiting improved, appetite enhanced, and nutritional intake was optimized. However, the specific fact \\'Patient recovered from surgery well; had flatus and bowel movement\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the summary. While the summary implies a successful recovery and improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms, it does not directly state that the patient had flatus or a bowel movement.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions the patient underwent laparoscopic small bowel resection with no acute postoperative complications and notes improved gastrointestinal symptoms, appetite, and nutritional intake. However, there is no explicit mention of flatus or bowel movement in any section. While postoperative bowel regimens (Miralax, Senna) and diet advancement are documented, these indicate management rather than confirmation of the specific outcomes (flatus/bowel movement). The absence of direct references to these milestones, despite describing recovery progress, means the fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 3, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** LLQ abdominal pain 2/2 cancer\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary contains a \\'Problem #3: Lower Abdominal Pain\\' section in the problem based summary. 2. Under \\'Current Clinical Status,\\' it explicitly states \\'recurrent LLQ pain potentially related to IBS.\\' 3. While IBS is mentioned as a possible contributor, the LLQ (left lower quadrant) abdominal pain is clearly documented. 4. The patient\\'s primary diagnosis is metastatic sigmoid adenocarcinoma (sigmoid colon being in the LLQ region), and the summary lists cancer related pain in other areas (e.g., bony pain). 5. However, the text does not explicitly state that the LLQ pain is attributed to cancer (2/2 cancer) The IBS attribution creates ambiguity, and no direct causal link to malignancy is made. 6. While a clinician might infer cancer related pain given the anatomy and metastatic disease, the summary does not explicitly make this connection for the LLQ pain.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 4, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pancreatic tail mass leading to outpatient GI biopsy\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I find that while a pancreatic tail mass is clearly documented and GI consultation is mentioned, the summary does not explicitly state that an outpatient GI biopsy was arranged or completed. The summary indicates that a biopsy is planned but still pending: 1) Under Problem #1, it states \\'Initial oncology workup was initiated with a GI consultation for biopsy\\' and lists \\'Pending biopsy and comprehensive oncology evaluation\\' under Outstanding/Pending Issues. 2) The summary recommends \\'endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS/FNA) and surgical consultation\\' but this is presented as a future plan rather than a completed action. 3) The discharge plan mentions \\'Follow up with gastroenterology for EUS/FNA,\\' indicating the biopsy has not yet occurred. While a biopsy is clearly planned, the specific fact of it leading to an outpatient GI biopsy is not explicitly stated as having occurred.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient was admitted for an expedited oncology workup following the discovery of a 2.1 cm pancreatic tail mass. It further states that a GI consultation for biopsy was initiated during the hospital stay. The summary under \\'Problem #1: Pancreatic Tail Mass\\' mentions that the patient had a GI consultation for biopsy and that further evaluation with EUS/FNA and surgical consultation was planned. However, it does not explicitly state that the pancreatic tail mass led to an outpatient GI biopsy. Instead, it indicates that the GI consultation and biopsy were pending or planned at the time of discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 5, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Increased bloody output from JP drain observed on POD1, gradually improved\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that increased bloody JP drain output is mentioned in two places: 1. In the Medications section, it notes \\'heparin for thromboprophylaxis (held post operatively due to increased JP output)\\' 2. In Problem #1 under Format 2, it states \\'observed to have increased and dark red JP output postoperatively\\' However, while the summary mentions increased JP output, it does not explicitly state that this occurred on POD1 specifically, nor does it explicitly mention that it \\'gradually improved.\\' While the summary does mention \\'improving JP drain output\\' in the Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge section, the complete temporal sequence specified in the fact (POD1 onset and gradual improvement) is not fully detailed in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient was admitted for hypotension attributed to an adrenal crisis. The patient has a history of Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome (APS) Type 2, which includes primary adrenal insufficiency. The summary also details the administration of hydrocortisone stress dosing and the tapering of the dosage, indicating management of adrenal crisis. However, it does not explicitly state that the adrenal crisis was due to intolerance of PO prednisone. The summary lists the patient\\'s home medications, which included Prednisone 2.5 mg BID, but does not directly link intolerance to this medication as the cause of the adrenal crisis. Therefore, while the summary implies that the patient had an adrenal crisis and was on prednisone, it does not clearly state that the crisis was likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions adrenal crisis in the context of primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS) Type 2. However, there is no explicit mention of \\'intolerance of PO prednisone\\' as a contributing factor. While the summary documents the use of IV hydrocortisone (tapered to PO hydrocortisone) and lists prednisone 2.5 mg BID as part of adjusted home medications, it does not state that the adrenal crisis was caused by an inability to tolerate oral prednisone. The adrenal crisis is attributed to hypotension and hypovolemia (from nausea/vomiting), but the text does not link these issues to prednisone intolerance. The absence of this specific causal relationship meets the criteria for 0, as the fact (or a plainly equivalent phrase) is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, while Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is mentioned multiple times as part of the patient\\'s medical history and problems, there is no specific mention of insulin being changed to Lantus 15 units twice a day. The summary mentions insulin management in several places: 1. \\'Insulin drip for glucose control, transitioned to subcutaneous insulin\\' (Section 7) 2. \\'Insulin drip initiated and later transitioned to subcutaneous insulin dosing\\' (Section 8) 3. Under Problem #2 regarding T1DM, it states \\'Continue home insulin regimen\\' However, nowhere does it specifically state that the insulin was changed to Lantus 15 units twice daily. While insulin adjustments were clearly made, this specific change is not explicitly documented in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and that their insulin regimen was re evaluated during hospitalization. It states that the patient was initially managed with an insulin drip, which was later transitioned to subcutaneous insulin. However, it does not explicitly mention that the insulin was changed to Lantus 15 units twice a day. The summary does mention that the patient was to continue their home insulin regimen at discharge, but it does not specify the details of this regimen.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions transitioning from insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin and adjusting the home insulin regimen. However, it does not explicitly state that the insulin was changed to Lantus (insulin glargine) at a dose of 15 units twice daily. The summary refers generally to \\'subcutaneous insulin\\' and \\'home insulin regimen\\' without specifying the type (Lantus) or the exact dosage (15 units BID). While insulin management is discussed, the specific fact in question is not clearly mentioned in either the medications section, problem based summary, or conclusion.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 6, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Vitamin D deficiency, started on replacement, fat soluble vitamins sent, need to follow-up \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Analyzing the hospital course summary step by step: 1. In the \\'Medications\\' section, there is explicit mention of \\'Vitamin D 50,000 IU q4 weeks\\' 2. However, there is no mention of: Starting vitamin D replacement as a new intervention Fat soluble vitamin testing or monitoring Specific follow up plans related to vitamin D or fat soluble vitamins 3. While vitamin D is being given, we cannot confirm this was newly started during this admission or that fat soluble vitamins were sent for testing 4. The follow up plans mentioned in the summary focus on endocrine, psychiatric, and other issues, but not specifically vitamin D monitoring Therefore, while vitamin D administration is mentioned, the complete set of facts we\\'re looking for (new start, fat soluble vitamin testing, and specific follow up plans) is not explicitly present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient was started on \\'Vitamin D 50,000 IU q4 weeks.\\' This indicates that Vitamin D replacement was initiated. However, there is no explicit mention of \\'fat soluble vitamins sent\\' or a specific instruction to \\'follow up\\' on Vitamin D levels or fat soluble vitamins. The summary does mention follow up with endocrinology, which could potentially include Vitamin D level monitoring, but it is not explicitly stated for Vitamin D or fat soluble vitamins.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 7, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second-line\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary in both formats (standard section based and problem based), there is no explicit mention of a hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo (ipilimumab/nivolumab) or a switch to cabozantinib as second line therapy. While the summary mentions \\'History of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for RCC\\' in the medical history section, it does not specify which agents were used or any reactions to them. The summary focuses primarily on the patient\\'s surgical management of RCC and subsequent postoperative course. There are no mentions of immunotherapy complications or changes in systemic therapy regimens.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, medical history, surgical history, primary and secondary diagnoses, diagnostic investigations, therapeutic procedures, medications, and condition at discharge. To determine if the fact \\'Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second line\\' is mentioned, we need to look for any reference to \\'ipi/nivo\\' (ipilimumab/nivolumab) or \\'cabozantinib\\' and any indication of a hypersensitivity reaction or a switch in medication. Upon reviewing the summary, there is no mention of \\'ipi/nivo\\', \\'cabozantinib\\', or any hypersensitivity reaction related to these medications. The summary discusses the patient\\'s treatment for left renal cell carcinoma (RCC) involving neoadjuvant chemotherapy but does not specify the chemotherapy regimen or any change in the treatment plan related to \\'ipi/nivo\\' or \\'cabozantinib\\'.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeded as follows: 1) Reviewed \\'Relevant Medical History\\' which mentions neoadjuvant chemotherapy but no immunotherapy agents (ipi/nivo). 2) Scanned \\'Medications\\' section no mention of ipilimumab, nivolumab, or cabozantinib. 3) Checked \\'Therapeutic Procedures\\' focused on surgical management without immunotherapy references. 4) Examined \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\' liver enzyme elevations were attributed to postoperative status, not drug reactions. 5) Reviewed all problem lists and discharge plans no documentation of immunotherapy use, hypersensitivity reactions, or treatment changes to cabozantinib. The summary contains no references to immunotherapy agents (ipi/nivo) or their discontinuation due to hypersensitivity, nor any mention of cabozantinib initiation.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 8, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Down\\'s syndrome, neurogenic bladder, admitted for pneumonia, treated with CAP regimen and vancomycin due to positive sputum culture for MRSA\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Down\\'s syndrome: Explicitly mentioned under \\'Relevant Medical History\\'. 2. Neurogenic bladder: Listed in both medical history and secondary diagnoses. 3. Admitted for pneumonia: Clearly stated as the reason for admission and primary diagnosis. 4. CAP regimen: Ceftriaxone and azithromycin (standard CAP antibiotics) are documented in therapeutic procedures. 5. Vancomycin use: Added later and documented in medications. 6. MRSA rationale: Sputum culture showed rare Staph aureus (not explicitly MRSA), but MRSA nares PCR was positive. While vancomycin use aligns with MRSA coverage, the specific linkage to a positive sputum culture for MRSA is absent. The fact requires explicit sputum based MRSA confirmation for full alignment, which is missing.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find any explicit mention of: 1) an aspiration event prior to discharge, 2) blood cultures with 1/4 bottles positive for GPC (Gram positive cocci), or 3) pending speciation results. The summary does mention several microbiology results including urine culture (Staphylococcus aureus and gram negative rods), sputum culture (Staphylococcus aureus), and MRSA nares PCR, but there is no mention of blood culture results or any aspiration events. The discharge section indicates the patient was stable without complications, and while the patient has a history of dysphagia with G tube placement, no acute aspiration events are documented. The \\'Outstanding/Pending Issues\\' sections for each problem also do not mention any pending culture results or aspiration concerns.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, treatment, and discharge. To determine if the fact \\'Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\' is mentioned, we need to look for any reference to an aspiration event, blood culture results (since \\'bottles\\' likely refers to blood culture bottles), or Gram positive cocci (GPC). The summary does not explicitly mention any aspiration event prior to discharge. It discusses the patient\\'s pneumonia and treatment but does not specify an aspiration event. Additionally, there is no mention of blood culture results or GPC in the provided summary. The microbiology section mentions sputum and urine cultures but does not indicate a potential aspiration event or the specified blood culture results. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis focused on three key elements from the fact: 1) Aspiration event prior to discharge, 2) 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, and 3) Speciation incomplete at discharge. The hospital course mentions the patient\\'s dysphagia and G tube (aspiration risk) but does not describe an aspiration event occurring near discharge. Microbiology results include urine/sputum cultures (Staph aureus, gram negative rods) and MRSA PCR, but no mention of \\'1/4 bottles\\' or GPC. All reported cultures had completed speciation (e.g., \\'Staphylococcus aureus\\' identified). No pending microbiology results are noted in discharge documentation. None of the three components of the fact are explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the key components of the fact: 1. Sepsis from urinary source: The summary mentions \\'complicated urinary tract infection\\' and \\'septic encephalopathy\\', confirming sepsis from a urinary source. 2. Potential pyelonephritis: The summary explicitly states \\'possible developing pyelonephritis\\' multiple times. 3. 7 day course of cipro on discharge: This specific detail is NOT mentioned. While antibiotics are discussed (Vancomycin, Zosyn), there is no mention of Cipro or a 7 day course. 4. Started on finasteride: This is explicitly mentioned \\'Initiation of Finasteride for prostatomegaly related to UTI\\' and \\'New prescription: Finasteride 5 mg QHS\\'. 5. Prevention of future UTIs: While finasteride was started, it\\'s specifically mentioned for prostatomegaly rather than explicitly for UTI prevention. While many elements are present, the specific antibiotic (Cipro) and duration (7 days) are not mentioned, which are key components of the fact to verify.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient was admitted with a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) with possible developing pyelonephritis. The summary also indicates that the patient was started on finasteride for prostatomegaly related to UTI in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. However, the summary does not explicitly state that the patient was finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge. Instead, it mentions that the patient was continued on antibiotics (Zosyn during the stay) and discharged with instructions to continue oral antibiotics, though the specific antibiotic is not mentioned. The fact that the patient had sepsis is implied by the presence of septic encephalopathy, indicating sepsis was present. Therefore, the specific fact about sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis and starting finasteride is partially mentioned, but the detail about finishing a 7 day course of cipro is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course explicitly mentions sepsis (via \\'septic encephalopathy\\' diagnosis) from a urinary source (complicated UTI) with potential pyelonephritis (\\'possible developing pyelonephritis\\' in primary diagnosis). Finasteride initiation is documented for prostatomegaly related to UTI management, which aligns with preventing future UTIs. However, the summary does not mention a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin at discharge instead, the patient was continued on Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam) with no reference to cipro. Since one critical component of the fact (cipro use) is absent, the full fact as stated is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 12, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was started on empiric antibiotics but was found to have a normal WBC with normal lactate and abx were discontinued, he was not discharged on antibiotics\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed both formats of the hospital course summary, searching for any mention of empiric antibiotics being started and then discontinued due to normal WBC and lactate. While the summary mentions several aspects of the patient\\'s care including various medications, IV fluids, and potential consideration of antibiotics (\\'possible antibiotics if infection signs develop\\' under Problem #2), there is no explicit mention of: 1. Starting empiric antibiotics during this admission 2. Finding a normal WBC count and normal lactate 3. Discontinuing antibiotics due to these normal values 4. The patient\\'s antibiotic status at discharge While laboratory investigations are mentioned in the summary, they specifically note other values (potassium, sodium, hemoglobin, BUN, triglycerides, and glucose) but do not mention WBC or lactate levels. Therefore, this specific sequence of events regarding empiric antibiotics is not explicitly mentioned in the hospital course.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention that the patient was started on empiric antibiotics, had a normal WBC with normal lactate, and that antibiotics were discontinued. It also does not explicitly state that the patient was not discharged on antibiotics. However, under \\'Problem #2: Abdominal Pain and New Gallbladder Enteric Fistula,\\' it is mentioned that there is a \\'possible antibiotics if infection signs develop,\\' suggesting that antibiotics were not being used at discharge. The \\'Medications\\' section does not list antibiotics, supporting this inference. Still, the initial fact about starting and stopping antibiotics is not directly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed \\'Medications\\' section in Format 1: No mention of antibiotics being started or discontinued. Only lists continued home medications and IV fluids/TPN. 2. Checked \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\' in Format 1: WBC and lactate values are not reported only electrolytes, Hgb, BUN, triglycerides, and glucose are listed. 3. Examined Problem #2 in Format 2: States \\'possible antibiotics if infection signs develop\\' but no documentation of prior antibiotic initiation or discontinuation. 4. Scanned entire conclusion and discharge planning: No reference to antibiotic course management. While the text implies infection was considered (via \\'further evaluation for infection\\'), the specific sequence of antibiotic initiation followed by discontinuation due to normal labs is absent.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 12, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was discharged on TPN with instructions to follow up in 4 weeks  \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I reviewed the hospital course summary systematically, focusing on discharge related information in both Format 1 and Format 2. While the summary does mention that the patient was discharged on TPN (Format 1, Section 9: \\'with continuation of home TPN\\'), and discusses follow up care with home health services, it does not explicitly state that the patient was instructed to follow up in 4 weeks. The discharge planning sections mention follow up requirements in general terms (\\'frequent follow ups\\', \\'ongoing care management coordination\\') but do not specify a 4 week timeline. Since the specific timing of follow up (4 weeks) is not mentioned anywhere in the text, this fact cannot be considered explicitly present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, treatment, and discharge plan. To determine if the fact \\'He was discharged on TPN with instructions to follow up in 4 weeks\\' is mentioned, we need to look for evidence of discharge on TPN and any follow up instructions. The summary indicates that the patient was discharged with continuation of home TPN under \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge\\' and \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' for various problems. However, the specific follow up timeframe of \\'4 weeks\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the provided summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions the continuation of TPN at discharge in multiple sections (Medications, Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge, and Problem Based Summary discharge plans). However, the specific instruction to \\'follow up in 4 weeks\\' is not stated in the text. While follow up planning is mentioned in general terms (e.g., \\'frequent follow ups,\\' \\'follow up with cardiology,\\' \\'outpatient follow up plan\\'), the exact 4 week timeframe is absent. The summary emphasizes coordinated follow up but lacks the temporal specificity required by the target fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 13, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt has significant mental health history including anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder and did have a panic attack while admitted \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze this step by step: 1. The summary mentions the patient\\'s mental health history explicitly in multiple places: Under \\'Relevant Medical History\\': lists bipolar disorder, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, and anxiety attacks Under \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\': confirms bipolar disorder Under \\'Problem #5\\': specifically addresses \\'Mental Health Conditions (Bipolar, PTSD, Anxiety)\\' 2. However, while the mental health conditions are clearly documented, there is no explicit mention of a panic attack occurring during this admission. 3. The mental health section notes \\'without current exacerbations\\' and mentions the conditions were managed with medications \\'without current exacerbations.\\' 4. While anxiety is listed in the history and medications for mental health are mentioned (BuSpar, Seroquel, trazodone), there is no documentation of an acute panic attack during this hospitalization. Therefore, while most of the fact is present (mental health history), the specific claim about having a panic attack during admission is not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides a detailed account of the patient\\'s medical history, diagnoses, treatments, and condition at discharge. Under \\'Relevant Medical History,\\' it lists \\'Bipolar disorder,\\' \\'PTSD,\\' \\'Borderline personality disorder,\\' and \\'Anxiety attacks,\\' which correspond to the mental health conditions mentioned in the fact. However, it does not explicitly state that the patient had a panic attack during admission. The closest information is under \\'Problem #5: Mental Health Conditions (Bipolar, PTSD, Anxiety),\\' which indicates that the patient\\'s mental health conditions were managed without current exacerbations. This implies that there were no significant incidents like a panic attack during the hospital stay, but it does not directly confirm or deny the occurrence of a panic attack. The fact that the patient\\'s mental health conditions were managed without exacerbations suggests that if a panic attack occurred, it was not significant enough to be considered an exacerbation. Therefore, the specific fact that the patient \\'did have a panic attack while admitted\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly lists the patient\\'s mental health history as including bipolar disorder, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, and anxiety attacks under \\'Relevant Medical History\\' and \\'Problem #5: Mental Health Conditions\\'. However, there is no mention of a panic attack occurring during the current admission. The summary states that mental health conditions were \\'managed with ongoing medications without current exacerbations,\\' which does not indicate an acute event like a panic attack during hospitalization. While the mental health diagnoses are clearly documented, the specific occurrence of a panic attack while admitted is absent.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I can confirm that the fact about chronic medical conditions, including DM2 (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus), not being worsened perioperatively is implicitly addressed but not explicitly stated. While the summary does discuss diabetes management during the hospital stay: 1. It mentions that blood glucose was managed with insulin sliding scale 2. It notes that there were \\'slight elevations\\' that were managed 3. Under Problem #3, it states \\'Elevated blood glucose managed with insulin sliding scale; levels monitored regularly with slight elevations managed\\' 4. At discharge, there were \\'no outstanding/pending issues\\' related to diabetes However, the summary never explicitly states that DM2 or other chronic conditions were not worsened during the perioperative period. While we might infer this from the information provided, the specific fact we\\'re looking for is not directly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly addresses Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM2) under Problem #3, stating that elevated blood glucose was managed with an insulin sliding scale and that levels were monitored with \\'slight elevations managed.\\' While this indicates active management, there is no explicit statement that DM2 (or other chronic conditions) were not worsened perioperatively. Other chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension, mental health conditions) are similarly described as stable or managed without mention of perioperative exacerbation. The absence of any deterioration in chronic conditions is implied by the lack of reported complications and the focus on routine management, but the summary does not directly affirm that these conditions were not worsened during the perioperative period. The phrasing \\'were worsened perioperatively\\' is not explicitly stated or paraphrased in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary in both Format 1 and Format 2, viral gastroenteritis is not explicitly mentioned as the principal diagnosis at discharge. The summary provides multiple diagnoses and problems, with the primary diagnosis being listed as \\'Acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to nausea, vomiting, and volume depletion\\' in Format 1\\'s Primary Diagnosis section. While nausea and vomiting are mentioned as symptoms, their specific etiology (viral gastroenteritis) is not stated anywhere in the document. The summary discusses the resolution of these symptoms but does not attribute them to viral gastroenteritis. The conclusion section reiterates that the patient was admitted for \\'complications arising from nausea and vomiting leading to AKI\\' without specifying viral gastroenteritis as the underlying cause.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' as the principal diagnosis at discharge. The primary diagnosis listed is \\'Acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to nausea, vomiting, and volume depletion.\\' While the summary discusses nausea and vomiting, it does not attribute these symptoms to viral gastroenteritis. The section on \\'Nausea and Vomiting\\' under Problem Based Summary indicates that the symptoms were fully resolved but does not specify the cause. Therefore, the fact \\'Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** Step 1: Review the \\'Primary Diagnosis\\' section which lists \\'Acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to nausea, vomiting, and volume depletion\\' but does not mention viral gastroenteritis. Step 2: Check \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\' and \\'Problem Based Summary\\' sections for any reference to infectious etiology of gastrointestinal symptoms. No terms like \\'viral gastroenteritis,\\' \\'infectious diarrhea,\\' or equivalent synonyms are found. Step 3: Analyze the discharge conclusion, which attributes AKI to nausea/vomiting but does not specify their cause. While nausea/vomiting are symptoms of viral gastroenteritis, the summary does not name this diagnosis. Step 4: Confirm absence of diagnostic evidence (e.g., stool studies, viral panels) or treatment specific to viral gastroenteritis. Thus, the principal diagnosis at discharge remains AKI, with the cause of nausea/vomiting unspecified.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 16, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Currently on high dose dexamethasone and Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact is partially but not completely mentioned in the hospital course summary. While the summary does mention dexamethasone (\\'DexAMETHasone 4 mg BID\\') and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) in the Medications section, it does not explicitly state that the Bactrim is being used for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis. Additionally, while dexamethasone is mentioned at 4 mg BID (8 mg total daily), the summary doesn\\'t specify whether this constitutes \\'high dose\\' dexamethasone. Since we cannot confirm both the specific purpose of the Bactrim and whether the dexamethasone dose qualifies as \\'high dose\\', we cannot say the complete fact is explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 17, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Delirium tremens requiring intravenous benzodiazepines and phenobarbital for symptom control\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions treatment with IV phenobarbital (520 mg total) and lorazepam via CIWA protocol (including IV administration) for alcohol withdrawal. However, the term \\'delirium tremens\\' (DT) is never used in either the problem list, diagnoses, or treatment sections. While the clinical management aligns with DT treatment (IV benzodiazepines and phenobarbital), the summary only refers to \\'acute ethanol withdrawal syndrome with perceptual disturbance\\' and \\'acute encephalopathy\\' without explicitly naming DT. Since DT is a specific diagnosis requiring explicit mention (not just implied by treatment), and no equivalent phrasing (e.g., \\'severe alcohol withdrawal with autonomic instability\\') is documented, the fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups. While the summary does mention: 1. The patient was admitted with fever 2. Multiple diagnostic tests were performed including blood cultures (negative), chest X ray (showing only bibasilar atelectasis), and other workups 3. The patient received broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime) 4. The patient was noted to be \\'afebrile at discharge\\' However, the summary does not indicate that the fever was persistent during the hospital stay, nor does it specifically mention a suspected pulmonary infection. In fact, the chest X ray showed only atelectasis with \\'no focal consolidation.\\' The summary indicates the fever resolved with treatment, and the patient was classified as having \\'non neutropenic fever\\' without specifying a persistent course or suspected pulmonary source despite negative workups.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details a patient admitted with fever, who was managed for non neutropenic fever with broad spectrum antibiotics and became afebrile by discharge. The summary lists \\'Non neutropenic fever\\' under secondary diagnoses and describes the patient\\'s fever as managed with antibiotics. However, it does not explicitly mention a \\'suspected pulmonary infection.\\' The Chest X ray showed \\'bibasilar atelectasis with no focal consolidation,\\' which does not directly indicate a pulmonary infection. Blood cultures and urinalysis were negative for infection. The summary does indicate the patient was treated for fever with antibiotics, suggesting a suspected infection, but the specific suspicion of a pulmonary infection is not clearly stated. Thus, while there is mention of fever and its management, the specific fact of \\'persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\' is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states the patient was admitted with fever and received broad spectrum antibiotics. However, the chest X ray showed no focal consolidation (which would suggest pulmonary infection) and blood cultures/urinalysis were negative. While there is a mention of \\'non neutropenic fever\\' and negative infectious workups, there is no explicit statement of suspected pulmonary infection (e.g., no references to respiratory symptoms, pneumonia concerns, or specific pulmonary infection considerations). The absence of pulmonary infection suspicion despite negative workups means the full fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 19, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis).\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** While reviewing the hospital course summary, I found the following relevant information: 1. The summary mentions bilateral hydronephrosis in multiple sections (Medical History and Secondary Diagnoses) 2. The summary mentions urinary tract infections and specifically identifies Enterococcus faecalis in the urine culture 3. However, the summary does not mention ESBL E. coli or Klebsiella as causative organisms 4. While there are multiple references to UTIs and their treatment (including with ertapenem, which is often used for ESBL organisms), the specific combination of hydronephrosis being complicated by UTIs with all three specified organisms (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis) is not explicitly stated 5. Only Enterococcus faecalis is specifically mentioned in the culture results Therefore, while some elements are present (hydronephrosis and UTI with Enterococcus faecalis), the complete fact as stated is not fully present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission for a urinary tract infection (UTI) associated with a suprapubic catheter. The summary mentions that the patient has bilateral hydronephrosis and a UTI due to Enterococcus faecalis. The presence of hydronephrosis and its complication by UTI is evident. Although the summary does not explicitly list ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella as causative organisms alongside Enterococcus faecalis, it does indicate the presence of a complicated UTI. The urine culture specifically grew Enterococcus faecalis, and the patient was treated accordingly. The fact that hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections is supported by the presence of hydronephrosis and the UTI diagnosis. However, the specific organisms mentioned in the fact (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis) are not all listed together in the culture results provided. Still, the summary does indicate a complicated UTI in the context of hydronephrosis and mentions Enterococcus faecalis as a causative organism. Therefore, while not all details of the fact are explicitly mentioned, the summary implies that hydronephrosis is complicated by a UTI.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'Chronic bilateral hydronephrosis\\' in the medical history and secondary diagnoses, and the urine culture identified Enterococcus faecalis. However, there is no explicit mention of ESBL E. coli or Klebsiella in the urine culture results or clinical documentation. While the UTI is described as complicated (associated with a suprapubic catheter), the specific statement that hydronephrosis is complicated by UTIs caused by all three listed organisms (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis) is not present. Only Enterococcus faecalis is confirmed in the culture, with no reference to ESBL producing organisms or Klebsiella.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\' is partially mentioned in the summary. The worsening thrombocytopenia is explicitly documented in multiple places: 1. In the Reason for Admission section: \\'progressive thrombocytopenia\\' 2. In Problem #2: showing platelet nadir of 42 However, there is no mention of a prednisone taper initiation. Instead, the summary shows prednisone was actually increased: 1. Started at 40 mg daily 2. Increased to 100 mg daily for ITP dosing (as of 05/15/2023) Since the fact requires both components (worsening thrombocytopenia AND prednisone taper initiation), and the prednisone management described is opposite to a taper, this specific fact as stated is not fully present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, and treatment. The patient was admitted for extension of right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and progressive thrombocytopenia. Under \\'Problem #2: Thrombocytopenia,\\' it is mentioned that the patient was managed with an increased prednisone dosage, showing slight improvement. The initial prednisone dose was 40 mg daily, which was increased to 100 mg daily for ITP dosing as of 05/15/2023. The summary also indicates that the patient had chronic thrombocytopenia with a nadir of 42 and a current platelet count of 82 at discharge. The fact \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\' is not explicitly mentioned. Instead, the summary states that the prednisone dosage was increased, not tapered. Therefore, the specific fact regarding \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\' is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly states \\'progressive thrombocytopenia\\' under Reason for Admission and Problem #2, which is a clear clinical synonym for \\'worsening thrombocytopenia.\\' 2. The medications section documents prednisone initiation (40 mg daily) and later an increase to 100 mg daily for ITP dosing. However, there is no mention of a prednisone taper (i.e., planned dose decrease) in the summary. The term \\'taper\\' or equivalent phrasing (e.g., dose reduction schedule) is absent. While prednisone was initiated and adjusted, the specific concept of a taper is not explicitly stated. 3. Since the fact requires both components (\\'worsening thrombocytopenia\\' and \\'s/p prednisone taper initiation\\'), and only the first is confirmed, the combined fact is not fully mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 20, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing both the standard section based summary and problem based summary sections of the hospital course, there is no explicit mention of ordering twice weekly CBCs after discharge. While there are several references to monitoring labs during the hospital stay and general follow up plans (e.g., \\'Re evaluation of hematologic parameters and pending follow up labs\\' under Problem #2: Thrombocytopenia), the specific instruction for twice weekly CBC monitoring after discharge is not documented. The closest references are to \\'regular monitoring\\' and \\'routine follow up,\\' but these are not equivalent to the specific frequency of twice weekly CBCs.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, treatment, and discharge plan. To determine if the fact \\'Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\' is mentioned, we need to review the sections related to the patient\\'s condition at discharge and follow up plans. The summary includes a section on \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge\\' and \\'Problem Based Summary\\' with discharge plans for various problems. However, upon reviewing these sections, there is no explicit mention of ordering twice weekly CBCs after discharge. The discharge medications and follow up plans are discussed, but the specific frequency of CBC monitoring post discharge is not stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis begins by examining both the standard section based summary and problem based summary for any mention of CBC frequency post discharge. The \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' sections under Problem #2 (Thrombocytopenia) state \\'Continued monitoring of platelet counts\\' and \\'pending follow up labs\\' but do not specify frequency. The standard discharge summary mentions follow up arrangements but no lab frequency details. While monitoring is clearly indicated, the specific instruction for \\'twice weekly CBCs\\' is absent in all sections. No abbreviations (e.g., \\'CBC q2wk\\') or equivalent phrasing exists in the document. The absence of explicit frequency qualifiers meets criteria for 0.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, while falls are mentioned as part of the admission reason (\\'admitted following multiple falls at home\\'), there is no explicit mention of recurrent falls during the hospital stay or any indication of an extensive inpatient workup for unexplained falls. The summary discusses the initial falls that led to admission and their consequence (T6 compression fracture), but does not describe ongoing or recurrent falls during the hospitalization. Additionally, while various diagnostic tests were performed (CT scans, X rays, labs), these appear to be focused on evaluating the injuries from the initial falls rather than investigating unexplained recurrent falls during the hospital stay. Therefore, the specific fact of \\'recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\' is not explicitly mentioned in this summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details Mrs. Leila Wiltshire\\'s admission following multiple falls at home, indicating that falls were a significant issue. The summary outlines an extensive workup for her conditions, including diagnostic investigations like CT scans and lab results. Although the summary does not explicitly state \\'recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient,\\' it implies that the patient experienced multiple falls and underwent a thorough evaluation during her hospitalization. The primary reason for admission was syncope/fall evaluation, and various diagnostic tests were conducted to assess her condition. However, the exact phrase or a direct statement regarding the etiology of the falls remaining unknown post workup is not present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient was admitted for evaluation of multiple falls and details the diagnostic workup performed (CT scans, X rays, lab tests, cardiac monitoring). However, it does not explicitly state that the etiology of the falls remains unknown despite this workup. While the summary lists potential contributors (e.g., dementia, heart failure, NSVT) and describes interventions (e.g., medication adjustments, PT/OT), there is no clear statement indicating the falls were of \\'unknown etiology\\' after evaluation. The workup identified contributing factors (e.g., T6 fracture, cardiac issues) but did not explicitly conclude that the root cause remained undetermined.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, while a T6 wedge compression fracture is clearly mentioned multiple times, there is no explicit statement indicating that this fracture likely occurred before the most recent fall. The summary mentions \\'likely subacute T6 compression fracture\\' and describes it as an \\'interval anterior wedge compression deformity of T6\\' in the CT findings, but does not specifically state or suggest the timing of the fracture in relation to the recent fall. While the term \\'subacute\\' might suggest the fracture wasn\\'t entirely new, this alone isn\\'t explicit enough to confirm it predated the most recent fall. The summary discusses multiple falls but doesn\\'t establish a clear timeline between the falls and the fracture\\'s occurrence.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the entire hospital course summary, including both the standard section based and problem based formats, there is no explicit mention of continuing or re evaluating Augmentin therapy for a 14 day course. While the summary discusses antibiotic therapy (specifically mentioning Zosyn), and includes information about wound infection and cholangitis treatment, it does not specifically mention Augmentin or any plans to re evaluate antibiotic therapy at a specific timepoint. The only antibiotic specifically mentioned is Zosyn as empiric therapy. The discharge plans mention continuing antibiotics in general but do not specify Augmentin or a 14 day course review plan.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was thoroughly reviewed to determine if the fact \\'should continue and re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary details the patient\\'s management for cholangitis, including empirical antibiotic therapy initiated with Zosyn. However, it does not mention \\'Augmentin\\' at all, nor does it discuss the evaluation or continuation of Augmentin therapy. The discharge plan for cholangitis involves continuing antibiotics and follow up with Gastroenterology and Hematology/Oncology. While the summary indicates the use of antibiotics, it specifies Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) as the empiric antibiotic therapy, not Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate). Therefore, the specific fact regarding Augmentin therapy is not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1. The \\'Important Fact\\' requires documentation about continuing and re evaluating Augmentin therapy before completing 14 days. 2. The hospital course summary\\'s \\'Empiric antibiotic therapy\\' section explicitly lists Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam), not Augmentin. 3. The discharge plan for cholangitis states \\'Continue antibiotics\\' but does not specify Augmentin or any plan to reassess duration. 4. No other sections mention Augmentin, its continuation, or re evaluation of therapy duration. Since Augmentin is not referenced in any form (brand/generic/synonym) and the documented antibiotic regimen involves Zosyn, the fact is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 22, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** patient should follow up with Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/ Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Poultsides, George, MD in in 2 weeks\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the entire hospital course summary, including both the standard section based summary and problem based summary formats, as well as the conclusion, there is no explicit mention of follow up appointments with either an Advanced Practice Provider in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. While the summary does mention several follow up requirements (e.g., with Gastroenterology, Hematology/Oncology, SLP, Nutrition, and specifically mentions Dr. Butler for oncology follow up), it does not specify the particular follow up schedule being sought. The only specific provider mentioned for follow up is Dr. Butler, not Dr. Poultsides, and there is no mention of a 1 week APP follow up or 2 week physician follow up schedule.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, treatment, and follow up plans. To determine if the specific fact about follow up appointments is mentioned, we need to look for any reference to scheduling follow ups with an Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant) and Dr. Poultsides, George, MD. Upon reviewing the summary, the \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' sections under various problems mention follow ups with different specialists. However, there is no explicit mention of a follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides, George, MD in 2 weeks. The summary mentions follow ups with various specialists like Gastroenterology, Hematology/Oncology, SLP, Nutrition, and others, but does not specify the exact timeframe or the particular providers mentioned in the fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed for mentions of follow up appointments with an Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. The discharge plans in both the standard and problem based summaries list follow ups with specialties (e.g., Gastroenterology, Oncology, SLP, Nutrition) and specific providers like Dr. Butler and a primary care provider/surgery team, but there is no explicit reference to an Advanced Practice Provider (NPP/PA) or Dr. Poultsides. The conclusion mentions \\'follow ups with relevant specialists\\' generally but does not specify these providers. Since neither the named providers nor the APP/NPP/PA roles with the stated timelines are mentioned, the fact is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 23, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing both Format 1 and Format 2 of the hospital course summary, including all sections and problem based summaries, there is no explicit mention of cardiology coordinating follow up with the Heart Failure team regarding transcatheter MVR or a clinical trial drug in April 2023. While the summary does mention cardiology follow up in general terms (under Problem #3: HFpEF \\'cardiology follow up\\') and discusses the patient\\'s history of mitral valve replacement, it does not specifically mention the coordination for transcatheter MVR or any clinical trial discussions. The closest related information is about the patient\\'s previous valve replacements in 2014 and current mitral stenosis noted on echocardiogram, but nothing about future MVR plans or clinical trials.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was thoroughly reviewed to determine if the fact \\'Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary includes detailed information about the patient\\'s medical history, diagnoses, treatments, and discharge plans. Under \\'Problem #3: Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)\\', it is mentioned that the patient will have \\'continued diuretic therapy and cardiology follow up.\\' However, there is no explicit mention of discussing \\'transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\' or any similar phrase that could be considered equivalent in meaning or context.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions cardiology follow up for heart failure management in Problem #3 (HFpEF) but does not contain any reference to coordination with the Heart Failure team regarding transcatheter mitral valve replacement (MVR) or a new clinical trial drug from April 2023. The summary details cardiology involvement in follow up care and mentions mitral valve replacement in the surgical history (2014), but there is no discussion of a transcatheter approach, clinical trials, or drug related updates specific to April 2023. The absence of these specific elements, including the Heart Failure team\\'s role in this context, indicates the fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 24, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** this (and prior) small bowel obstruction managed nonoperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states that the current small bowel obstruction (SBO) was managed with nonoperative measures, including NGT decompression, bowel rest, and IV fluids. However, while the summary mentions a history of \\'multiple prior small bowel obstructions,\\' it does not explicitly state whether these prior episodes were managed nonoperatively. The absence of any reference to prior surgical interventions for SBO (only the Whipple procedure for cholangiocarcinoma is noted) might suggest nonoperative management, but the text does not confirm this. Since the fact requires confirmation of both the current and prior SBOs being managed nonoperatively, and prior management is not explicitly addressed, the fact is not fully stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 25, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, the specific fact about the upper GI series findings and subsequent GI consultation is not explicitly mentioned in the same detail. While the summary does mention an \\'Upper GI contrast study\\' showing \\'no gastric outlet obstruction but mucosal fold thickening with nodularity along the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum,\\' and mentions duodenitis management with PPIs, it does not specifically mention: 1) The discussion with both general GI and advanced GI, 2) Their deferral of EGD/ERCP, or 3) The specific recommendation for 8 weeks of empiric PPI and outpatient ERCP evaluation. The summary only generally mentions \\'follow up with GI\\' and \\'consideration of further evaluation with MRCP/ERCP\\' without the specific details provided in the fact to be verified.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Upper GI series: The summary states \\'Upper GI contrast study: No gastric outlet obstruction but mucosal fold thickening...\\' which partially matches the fact\\'s first part but does not explicitly mention \\'no significant obstruction along the duodenum\\' (only notes mucosal changes). 2. IV famotidine to PPI: Famotidine is listed as continued, and pantoprazole is transferred to prescription, but no explicit switch from IV to PPI during hospitalization is documented. 3. GI consultation details: The summary mentions considering ERCP evaluation outpatient but does not explicitly state discussions with GI teams, deferral of EGD/ERCP, or 8 week PPI empiric therapy. While some elements are tangentially related, key components of the fact are not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 25, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, while there is mention of \\'mild renal impairment\\' in the secondary diagnoses and Problem #9 mentions \\'Mild Renal Impairment likely secondary to dehydration\\', there is no explicit statement that this was an AKI present on admission that resolved with fluid treatment. While Problem #9 mentions to \\'trial gentle hydration\\', it doesn\\'t specifically state that fluids were given and resolved an AKI. The summary mentions renal impairment but doesn\\'t clearly document the temporal course (admission vs. during stay) or its resolution with fluid therapy. Therefore, while renal issues are mentioned, the specific fact we\\'re looking for is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary lists \\'mild renal impairment\\' under Secondary Diagnoses (Format 1) and Problem #9 (Format 2). 2. The text states the renal impairment was \\'likely secondary to dehydration\\' and the discharge plan includes \\'trial gentle hydration.\\' 3. However, the term \\'AKI\\' (acute kidney injury) is never explicitly used, and there is no direct statement that the renal impairment was present on admission or that it resolved with fluids. While mild renal impairment could overlap clinically with AKI, the summary does not use equivalent terminology or explicitly describe resolution of this issue. 4. The fluid management mentioned (gentle hydration) appears in the discharge plan as a future action rather than documentation of treatment that already occurred.\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 26, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Metoprolol dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily for improved rate control; Apixaban dosage increased to 5 mg twice daily for anticoagulation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary for the specific fact about metoprolol and apixaban dosage changes. Here\\'s what I found: 1. Regarding metoprolol: The summary explicitly mentions in multiple places that metoprolol was increased to 75 mg BID (twice daily). This is found in both section 7 (\\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\') and section 8 (\\'Medications\\'). 2. Regarding apixaban: The summary mentions in section 8 that apixaban was \\'continued at 5 mg BID.\\' This indicates there was no increase in dosage it was maintained at the same level. Since the fact states both medications were increased, but only metoprolol was actually increased while apixaban was continued at the same dose, this means the complete fact as stated is not fully present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that \\'metoprolol dosing was increased to 75 mg BID for better rate control\\' under the \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' section and \\'Metoprolol increased to 75 mg BID\\' under the \\'Medications\\' section. Additionally, it is stated that \\'Apixaban continued at 5 mg BID\\' under the \\'Medications\\' section. The fact that the metoprolol dosage was increased to 75 mg twice daily for improved rate control is directly mentioned. However, the summary does not explicitly state that the Apixaban dosage was increased to 5 mg twice daily; instead, it indicates that Apixaban was continued at this dosage. Despite this nuance, the essential information regarding metoprolol is present, and the continuation of Apixaban at the specified dose implies its dosage was maintained at that level.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** Step 1: Check for metoprolol dosage increase. Found in \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' section: \\'Increase in metoprolol dosing to 75 mg BID for better rate control.\\' BID (twice daily) matches the fact. Step 2: Check for apixaban dosage increase. The \\'Medications\\' section states \\'Apixaban continued at 5 mg BID.\\' The word \\'continued\\' indicates maintenance rather than an increase. No other sections mention apixaban dose escalation. While metoprolol adjustment is explicitly stated, apixaban is described as being continued at its current dose without reference to a prior lower dose. The specific fact requires both medications\\' doses to be increased, but only metoprolol\\'s increase is documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**34. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze this step by step: 1. The summary mentions CT findings of \\'moderate narrowing of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA)\\' in the diagnostic investigations section. 2. While emesis (vomiting) is mentioned as a presenting symptom, the summary does not explicitly connect it to chronic mesenteric ischemia. 3. The CT report specifically notes \\'no acute mesenteric ischemia.\\' 4. The patient\\'s symptoms are primarily attributed to other causes throughout the summary, including gastroparesis, gastritis/dyspepsia, and GERD. 5. While SMA stenosis is present, the summary does not make any causal connection between this finding and the patient\\'s emesis. Therefore, while SMA stenosis is mentioned, the specific fact that the patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia is not explicitly stated or suggested in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the CT Abdomen/Pelvis showed \\'moderate narrowing of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA); no acute mesenteric ischemia.\\' While it does not directly state that the patient\\'s emesis is related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, it does provide evidence of SMA stenosis, which is a key component of the condition. However, the summary does not explicitly link the patient\\'s emesis to chronic mesenteric ischemia. The fact that the patient had symptoms of nausea and vomiting, and the presence of SMA stenosis, are mentioned, but a direct causal relationship is not stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary mentions \\'severe nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain\\' as part of the reason for admission. 2. The CT abdomen/pelvis findings include \\'moderate narrowing of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA)\\' but explicitly state \\'no acute mesenteric ischemia.\\' 3. The summary attributes vomiting to gastroparesis (listed under secondary diagnoses) and hypovolemia (primary diagnosis), with management focused on fluid resuscitation and dietary modifications for gastroparesis. 4. While SMA stenosis is documented, there is no explicit linkage of emesis to chronic mesenteric ischemia in any section (diagnoses, problem based summary, or conclusion). The text specifically rules out acute ischemia but does not discuss chronic mesenteric ischemia as a potential contributor to symptoms. 5. The absence of phrases like \\'chronic mesenteric ischemia,\\' \\'SMA related emesis,\\' or equivalent clinical synonyms in the causal analysis of symptoms supports the conclusion that this specific connection is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**35. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient was admitted for neutropenic fever (under \\'Reason for Admission\\' and \\'Primary Diagnosis\\'). 2. Coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) bacteremia is listed as a secondary diagnosis and confirmed by blood cultures. However, crucially, the fact specifies \\'coagulase negative strep\\' (streptococcus), while the summary documents \\'Coagulase negative Staphylococcus\\' (staph). These are distinct organisms (staph vs. strep), making this a critical discrepancy. 3. PICC line removal is explicitly documented under \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' due to infection. However, replacement of the PICC line is not mentioned in the summary. 4. Antibiotic treatment (vancomycin, linezolid) is thoroughly documented. While the bacteremia was treated, the organism mismatch (staph vs. strep) and lack of explicit PICC replacement documentation mean the fact as stated is not fully present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**36. Patient 27, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary includes a TTE result under \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\' which states \\'No evidence of vegetations, normal LVEF (64%).\\' However, the summary does not explicitly mention the date of the TTE (3/6/23) or the absence of a mass. While the absence of vegetations is documented, the lack of both the specific date and the explicit exclusion of a mass means the full fact as stated is not present. The guidelines specify that paraphrased or abbreviated equivalents are acceptable, but the missing date and partial findings (only vegetations excluded) prevent full alignment with the stated fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**37. Patient 27, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the summary step by step for evidence of tonsilitis with imaging and treatment: 1. Imaging evidence: The summary mentions \\'CT maxillofacial: Clear sinuses with mild tonsillar enlargement\\' 2. Clinical diagnosis: \\'Possible tonsillitis\\' is listed under Secondary Diagnoses 3. Treatment: While antibiotics were given (piperacillin tazobactam, cefepime, vancomycin, linezolid), these were primarily for neutropenic fever and CoNS bacteremia, not specifically for tonsillitis 4. Localizing symptoms: The summary does not mention any specific tonsillar symptoms (e.g., sore throat, difficulty swallowing) 5. Problem list: While \\'Possible Tonsillitis\\' appears as Problem #7, it\\'s described only as \\'possibly related to imaging finding of mild enlarged tonsils\\' without clear treatment targeting this condition While there is imaging evidence of tonsillar enlargement and tonsillitis is mentioned as a possibility, the summary lacks explicit mention of localizing symptoms and targeted antibiotic treatment specifically for tonsillitis. The antibiotics given were clearly documented as being for other conditions.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary includes CT maxillofacial imaging showing \\'mild tonsillar enlargement\\' under Key Diagnostic Investigations. 2. \\'Possible tonsillitis\\' is listed as a secondary diagnosis, indicating clinical suspicion. 3. Antibiotics (including vancomycin and linezolid) were administered throughout the hospital course. However, there is no explicit mention of localizing symptoms (e.g., sore throat, dysphagia) supporting tonsillitis. While imaging findings and antibiotic treatment are present, the absence of documented symptoms related to tonsillitis means the full triad (imaging + symptoms + treatment) isn\\'t explicitly stated. The antibiotics were primarily directed at neutropenic fever and CoNS bacteremia rather than explicitly for tonsillitis.\\n\\n\\n\\n**38. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, while it is mentioned that the patient was discharged to home hospice care, there is no explicit statement that bilirubin failed to improve despite PTBD exchange, leading to the hospice decision. The summary actually indicates some improvement in bilirubin levels (from 17.6 mg/dL to 10.8 mg/dL during admission). Additionally, while the transition to hospice is documented, there is no mention that this decision was specifically made due to failed bilirubin improvement or that it was a joint decision with the patient/family. The closest information we have is the discharge status mentioning hospice care, but without the specific context of failed PTBD treatment leading to this decision.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, treatment, and discharge plan. To determine if the fact \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice\\' is mentioned, we need to look for evidence of bilirubin levels, PTBD exchange, and the decision to transition to home hospice. The summary indicates that total bilirubin decreased from 17.6 mg/dL to 10.8 mg/dL during admission, suggesting some improvement. It also mentions a PTBD revision and drain exchange on 04/21/2023. Additionally, the patient was discharged to home hospice care. However, the summary does not explicitly state that bilirubin \\'did not improve\\' despite PTBD exchange; instead, it shows a decrease in bilirubin levels. The fact that the patient was discharged to home hospice is clearly mentioned. Therefore, the statement is partially incorrect regarding bilirubin improvement.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states that the patient\\'s total bilirubin decreased from 17.6 mg/dL to 10.8 mg/dL during admission following PTBD exchange (04/21/2023), indicating improvement. The problem based summary also notes \\'persistent but reducing hyperbilirubinemia,\\' which implies ongoing but partial improvement. While the discharge to home hospice is explicitly documented, the text does not state that bilirubin \\'did not improve\\' despite PTBD exchange. The summary instead shows measurable improvement, albeit incomplete. The transition to hospice is attributed to the need for palliative care due to the underlying cholangiocarcinoma, not explicitly linked to a lack of bilirubin response.\\n\\n\\n\\n**39. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze each component of the fact systematically: 1. Sepsis requiring antibiotics and fluid resuscitation: While antibiotics (piperacillin tazobactam) were given for \\'possible cholangitis\\' and IV fluids were administered for dehydration, the term \\'sepsis\\' is not explicitly mentioned. Cholangitis is mentioned multiple times, but this isn\\'t equivalent to explicitly stating sepsis. 2. Delirium requiring pharmacotherapy: Delirium is mentioned in both the Secondary Diagnoses and as Problem #6 However, while medications like mirtazapine and melatonin are listed, they\\'re not explicitly linked to treating delirium (they\\'re listed \\'for sleep and mood\\') 3. Urinary retention requiring catheter: While Flomax is mentioned \\'to manage urinary output,\\' urinary retention isn\\'t explicitly mentioned There\\'s no mention of a urinary catheter While some elements are partially present (delirium, antibiotics, fluids), the specific combination and causal relationships described in the fact are not explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, treatment, and discharge plan. To determine if the specific fact \\'Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter\\' is mentioned, we need to analyze the summary for each component of this fact. The summary indicates that the patient was treated with piperacillin tazobactam for possible cholangitis, which suggests an infection, and received intravenous fluids for dehydration, aligning with \\'sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation.\\' It also mentions \\'delirium\\' under secondary diagnoses and problem #6, indicating it was managed with supportive care, though specific pharmacotherapy is not detailed. However, there is no explicit mention of \\'urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\' The patient was given Flomax to manage urinary output, but this does not directly indicate urinary retention or the use of a urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis: The summary mentions \\'recurrent cholangitis\\' treated with piperacillin tazobactam, which could imply infection management, but \\'sepsis\\' is not explicitly stated. 2. Aggressive fluid resuscitation: IV fluids (D5 LR, NS) are documented for dehydration/hypotension, but the term \\'aggressive\\' is not used. 3. Delirium pharmacotherapy: Delirium is listed as a diagnosis and managed with \\'supportive care,\\' but no specific pharmacotherapy (e.g., antipsychotics) is mentioned. 4. Urinary retention/catheter: Flomax is used for urinary output, but urinary retention and catheter placement are not documented. None of the three components are explicitly stated in the required specificity.\\n\\n\\n\\n**40. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that while the summary mentions the patient\\'s nasopharyngeal carcinoma and delirium as separate conditions, it does not explicitly state that management of the metastatic cancer was deferred to outpatient oncology due to the son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium. The summary does indicate that oncologic follow up will occur outpatient (mentioned in Problem #1: \\'Outpatient oncologic follow up\\'), but it doesn\\'t specify this was due to the son\\'s wishes or the patient\\'s delirium. The delirium is noted to have resolved by discharge (Problem #6), but there\\'s no mention of it affecting treatment decisions. Additionally, while the son\\'s involvement in care decisions is not mentioned anywhere in the summary. Therefore, while related elements are present (cancer, delirium, outpatient follow up), the specific fact about deferring management due to son\\'s wishes and delirium is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, treatment, and discharge plan. To determine if the fact \\'Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium\\' is mentioned, we need to look for any reference to the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma being deferred, the involvement of the patient\\'s son in decision making, and the impact of the patient\\'s delirium on this decision. Under \\'Problem #1: Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (T4)\\' in the problem based summary, it is stated that there is \\'outpatient oncologic follow up\\' planned, indicating that the management of the carcinoma was indeed deferred to an outpatient setting. However, there is no explicit mention of the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes or the patient\\'s delirium influencing this decision in the provided summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states under \\'Problem #1: Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (T4)\\' that the discharge plan includes \\'Outpatient oncologic follow up\\' and \\'Awaiting chemotherapy planning.\\' However, there is no mention of deferral of management being due to the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes or the patient\\'s delirium. While delirium is listed as a resolved secondary diagnosis (Problem #6), no connection is made between the delirium/son\\'s preferences and the decision to defer cancer management. The summary describes the plan for outpatient oncology follow up but does not specify the rationale for deferral as stated in the target fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**41. Patient 29, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that while aspiration events and oxygen requirements are mentioned in several places, the specific fact about temporary O2 requirement being explicitly linked to aspiration pneumonitis with subsequent SLP ordered NPO status is not clearly stated. The summary mentions: 1. \\'Cough, likely secondary to nasopharyngeal carcinoma with aspiration events\\' in Secondary Diagnoses 2. \\'Humidified High Flow Nasal Cannula Therapy (07/16/2023): Managed desaturation episodes\\' 3. \\'CXR (07/08/2023): Increase in left basilar opacities, concerning for aspiration\\' While these elements suggest similar clinical events, they don\\'t explicitly state that the O2 requirement was due to aspiration pneumonitis or that SLP made the patient NPO as a result. The closest connection is the mention of Speech Therapy involvement for \\'oral hygiene, ice chip trials, and swallowing function maintenance,\\' but this doesn\\'t explicitly state they made the patient NPO due to aspiration pneumonitis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was thoroughly reviewed to determine if the fact \\'Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary indicates that the patient had issues related to aspiration, as noted in \\'CXR (07/08/2023): Increase in left basilar opacities, concerning for aspiration\\' and \\'Cough, likely secondary to nasopharyngeal carcinoma with aspiration events.\\' Additionally, it mentions \\'Humidified High Flow Nasal Cannula Therapy (07/16/2023): Managed desaturation episodes,\\' which implies a temporary oxygen requirement. The patient was made NPO, as indicated by \\'Held: ... due to NPO status\\' and received speech therapy for oral hygiene and swallowing function maintenance. However, the specific fact that the temporary O2 requirement was \\'felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis\\' is not directly stated, nor is it explicitly mentioned that SLP made the patient strict NPO. The closest related information is the involvement of Speech Therapy for swallowing function maintenance and the patient being made NPO.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** Step 1: The summary mentions \\'CXR (07/08/2023): Increase in left basilar opacities, concerning for aspiration\\' and \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\', indicating suspicion of aspiration. Step 2: Under \\'Therapeutic Procedures\\', \\'Humidified High Flow Nasal Cannula Therapy (07/16/2023)\\' addresses oxygen requirements. Step 3: \\'Cough, likely secondary to nasopharyngeal carcinoma with aspiration events\\' in Secondary Diagnoses links cough to aspiration. Step 4: Speech therapy involvement is noted for swallowing, but no explicit mention of SLP enforcing NPO status. While aspiration and oxygen needs are addressed, the specific terms \\'aspiration pneumonitis\\' and \\'strict NPO by SLP\\' are not explicitly stated. The causal link (oxygen requirement \\'felt to\\' pneumonitis) and SLP\\'s role in NPO are implied but not directly articulated.\\n\\n\\n\\n### B.

All Inconsistent Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 3, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** LLQ abdominal pain 2/2 cancer\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states LLQ abdominal pain is due to cancer (2/2 cancer). 2. The Hospital Summary (Problem #3: Lower Abdominal Pain) attributes LLQ pain to \\'potentially related to IBS\\' without mentioning cancer etiology. 3. Cancer related pain is explicitly documented in other sections (e.g., \\'abdominal and back pain due to progressive bony disease\\'), but the LLQ pain is specifically linked to IBS in the summary. 4. These conflicting etiologies for LLQ pain create a direct contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 4, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pancreatic tail mass leading to outpatient GI biopsy\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The fact states \\'Pancreatic tail mass leading to outpatient GI biopsy\\', but the summary shows: Patient was admitted for expedited oncology workup of the pancreatic mass EUS/FNA biopsy was recommended but not yet performed Summary specifically mentions \\'pending biopsy\\' under outstanding issues Patient expressed dissatisfaction with delays and incomplete workup 2. The summary indicates the biopsy was planned but had not occurred yet, while the fact suggests it had already happened outpatient.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 5, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Increased bloody output from JP drain observed on POD1, gradually improved\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states JP drain output increased on POD1 then improved. 2. Summary\\'s Problem #1 notes \\'increased and dark red JP output postoperatively\\' (consistent with POD1 increase). 3. Discharge section states \\'improving JP drain output\\' (aligns with gradual improvement). 4. However, Conclusion section states \\'despite increasing JP drain output\\' \\'increasing\\' contradicts \\'gradually improved\\' in the fact. 5. Direct conflict exists in Conclusion\\'s wording vs Important Fact\\'s timeline.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states adrenal crisis was likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s discharge medications include Prednisone 2.5 mg BID without documenting intolerance. 3. Continued use of prednisone contradicts the assertion that intolerance caused the crisis. 4. Summary does not mention any adjustments due to prednisone intolerance, instead transitioning to hydrocortisone for treatment.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states insulin was changed to Lantus 15 units twice daily. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s \\'Medications\\' section states \\'transitioned to subcutaneous insulin\\' but specifies \\'Continue home insulin regimen\\' in T1DM discharge plan. 3. No mention of Lantus 15 units BID in discharge medications or regimen changes, creating a direct conflict with the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 8, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Down\\'s syndrome, neurogenic bladder, admitted for pneumonia, treated with CAP regimen and vancomycin due to positive sputum culture for MRSA\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states sputum culture was positive for MRSA, driving vancomycin use. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s sputum culture shows \\'rare to small number of Staphylococcus aureus\\' without MRSA specification. 3. MRSA nares PCR positive indicates colonization, not sputum confirmed MRSA pneumonia. 4. Summary\\'s microbiology data does not confirm MRSA in sputum, contradicting the stated reason for vancomycin use.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary does not mention any aspiration event prior to discharge 2. While blood cultures are mentioned in the Important Fact (1/4 bottles positive for GPC), the summary only mentions urine and sputum cultures, with no reference to blood culture results 3. Since these potentially significant findings (aspiration event and positive blood culture) are not mentioned in what appears to be a detailed hospital course summary, this represents a significant omission that makes the summary inconsistent with the Important Fact 4. The summary concludes that the patient was discharged in stable condition without mentioning these potentially serious clinical events 5. Given that blood cultures were positive and speciation was pending at discharge, this should have been included in the \\'Outstanding/Pending Issues\\' section, but was not\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by discharge\\'. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s Microbiology section reports sputum culture identified \\'Staphylococcus aureus\\' (a GPC) with speciation completed. 3. Completed speciation in the summary directly contradicts the fact\\'s claim of incomplete speciation. 4. This creates an irreconcilable conflict between the two statements.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows the patient was treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn during hospitalization, not Cipro 2. While finasteride was indeed started as mentioned in both texts, the antibiotic course details differ 3. The summary does not mention a 7 day course of Cipro for discharge 4. The summary indicates continuing antibiotics but specifically mentions Zosyn rather than Cipro 5. These differences in antibiotic choice and course represent a clear contradiction\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient was finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge for sepsis from a urinary source with potential pyelonephritis and was started on finasteride to prevent future UTIs. The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient was diagnosed with a complicated urinary tract infection with possible developing pyelonephritis and was treated with antibiotics (initially Vancomycin, then Zosyn). It mentions that finasteride was initiated for prostatomegaly related to UTI. However, the summary does not mention the patient being on cipro or finishing a 7 day course of it on discharge. The summary is consistent with the fact that finasteride was started, aligning with the attempt to prevent future UTIs or manage prostatomegaly.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states patient was \\'finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge,\\' but the Hospital Summary specifies antibiotics were \\'Vancomycin initially, continued on Zosyn\\' with no mention of ciprofloxacin in discharge medications. 2. Summary explicitly lists \\'Zosyn\\' under Medications and discharge instructions to \\'continue oral antibiotics\\' without naming cipro. 3. Urine culture sensitivities were still pending at discharge, making cipro use unconfirmed. These details conflict directly with the claim of a completed cipro course.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The Important Fact states the patient had an \\'unremarkable post operative course\\', but the Hospital Course Summary shows several notable post operative issues: High lidocaine levels that required monitoring and later normalized Required transition from ketamine/lidocaine drips to oral Dilaudid for pain control Had elevated blood glucose levels requiring insulin adjustment Experienced initial blood pressure elevations 2. The conclusion explicitly states the hospital course was \\'remarkable\\', directly contradicting the Important Fact\\'s claim of \\'unremarkable\\'\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'unremarkable post operative course\\'. 2. Hospital Summary Conclusion section explicitly states \\'her hospital course was remarkable\\'. 3. \\'Remarkable\\' directly contradicts \\'unremarkable\\' in the context of post operative course description. 4. This creates a clear contradiction as both cannot be true simultaneously.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 13, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt has significant mental health history including anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder and did have a panic attack while admitted \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states patient \\'did have a panic attack while admitted\\'. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s \\'Problem #5: Mental Health Conditions\\' explicitly states \\'managed with ongoing medications... without current exacerbations\\'. 3. No documentation of panic attacks occurring during admission in any section (Reason for Admission, Key Investigations, Therapeutic Procedures, or Discharge Condition). 4. Absence of acute mental health events contradicts the Important Fact\\'s claim of an in hospital panic attack.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions that blood glucose was elevated post operatively and required management with insulin sliding scale 2. Specifically, under Problem #3: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, it states \\'Elevated blood glucose managed with insulin sliding scale; levels monitored regularly with slight elevations managed\\' 3. This indicates her DM2 was temporarily worsened perioperatively, requiring additional insulin management 4. This directly contradicts the Important Fact which states her chronic conditions including DM2 were not worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient\\'s blood glucose levels were elevated post surgery and managed with an insulin sliding scale, which contradicts the Important Fact that her chronic medical conditions, including DM2, were not worsened perioperatively. The summary under Problem #3: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus states that \\'Elevated blood glucose managed with insulin sliding scale,\\' showing that DM2 was indeed affected perioperatively.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The hospital course summary clearly identifies the primary diagnosis as \\'Acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to nausea, vomiting, and volume depletion\\' in section 4. 2. This contradicts the provided fact stating the principal diagnosis at discharge was \\'viral gastroenteritis\\'. 3. Throughout the entire summary, there is no mention of viral gastroenteritis as a diagnosis or suspected cause. 4. The summary attributes the patient\\'s symptoms (nausea/vomiting) to volume depletion leading to AKI, not to a viral infection. 5. The treatment approach described (IV fluids, holding nephrotoxic medications) aligns with managing AKI rather than viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the principal diagnosis at discharge is viral gastroenteritis. 2. The Hospital Course Summary lists \\'Acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to nausea, vomiting, and volume depletion\\' as the Primary Diagnosis. 3. Viral gastroenteritis is not mentioned in any diagnosis section (Primary/Secondary) or problem list. 4. Nausea/vomiting is attributed to volume depletion leading to AKI, not to an infectious etiology. 5. These are mutually exclusive principal diagnoses AKI from volume depletion vs viral gastroenteritis as per the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 17, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Delirium tremens requiring intravenous benzodiazepines and phenobarbital for symptom control\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'delirium tremens\\' requiring IV benzodiazepines and phenobarbital. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s Primary Diagnosis is \\'acute ethanol withdrawal syndrome with perceptual disturbance\\' (a distinct diagnosis from delirium tremens). 3. Summary explicitly states \\'no history of withdrawal seizures\\' and documents CIWA protocol use (common in withdrawal management), but never mentions delirium tremens. 4. Delirium tremens and acute withdrawal with perceptual disturbance are mutually exclusive diagnoses requiring different clinical documentation. 5. Presence of one diagnosis (acute withdrawal) directly contradicts the assertion of the other (delirium tremens).\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary does not contradict the fact about persistent fever and suspected pulmonary infection. 2. In fact, the summary shows: Patient was admitted with fever but became afebrile by discharge Chest X ray showed only bibasilar atelectasis, no consolidation Blood cultures showed no growth Patient received broad spectrum antibiotics and improved No mention of persistent fever or ongoing pulmonary concerns 3. The clinical course described shows resolution of fever rather than persistence, and workup did not suggest pulmonary infection.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\'. 2. Hospital summary documents \\'non neutropenic fever\\' as a secondary diagnosis. 3. Chest X ray showed \\'no focal consolidation\\' (no pulmonary infection evidence). 4. Blood cultures showed \\'no growth\\', urinalysis negative. 5. Summary states patient was \\'afebrile at discharge after broad spectrum antibiotics\\'. 6. This indicates fever resolved with antibiotics despite negative workups, contradicting \\'persistent\\' fever in the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 18, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma recently complicated by progression to CNS lymphoma\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)\\' with CNS progression. 2. Hospital Summary specifies \\'High grade B cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 translocations\\' as the primary diagnosis. 3. High grade B cell lymphoma with MYC/BCL2 rearrangements is a distinct entity from DLBCL per WHO classification (double hit lymphoma). 4. These are mutually exclusive diagnoses; the summary directly contradicts the lymphoma subtype.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 18, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states AKI with hypokalemia resolved during admission. 2. Summary\\'s discharge condition states \\'renal function normalized\\' (AKI resolved) but lists \\'mild hypokalemia managed with supplementation\\' under Problem #5. 3. Hypokalemia is described as \\'addressed\\' but not resolved, requiring ongoing monitoring. 4. Both conditions must resolve per the fact; unresolved hypokalemia creates contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 19, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis).\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions urine culture showing only Enterococcus faecalis, while the fact states ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis were present. 2. The summary\\'s diagnostic section specifically states \\'Urine culture: Enterococcus faecalis, sensitivities pending\\' without mentioning the other organisms. 3. The treatment section mentions transitioning from ertapenem to Augmentin, which would be inappropriate for ESBL organisms, suggesting these weren\\'t present. 4. This represents a clear contradiction in the microbiology findings.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 20, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** HHT with new PE/DVT s/p IVC filter placement as well as changed to fondaparinux\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the patient was \\'changed to fondaparinux\\', implying current use. 2. The Summary shows fondaparinux was started on 05/09/2023 but later switched to apixaban by 05/16/2023 (discharge medication: apixaban). 3. These anticoagulant changes are mutually exclusive; the Summary contradicts the Fact by documenting a subsequent switch away from fondaparinux.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\' implying platelet decline after starting steroid taper. 2. Hospital summary documents \\'improved thrombocytopenia\\' (nadir 42 → Plt 82) and specifically states prednisone was increased to 100 mg daily for ITP (05/15), not tapered. 3. Summary shows platelet improvement with dose escalation, directly contradicting the notion of worsening after taper initiation.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient.\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary identifies multiple potential contributors to falls: T6 fracture (primary diagnosis), HFrEF, NSVT (managed with metoprolol adjustment), dementia, and CKD. 3. The summary documents extensive workup including CTs, X rays, labs, and specialist evaluations. 4. Since specific contributing factors were identified through this workup, the etiology is not \\'unknown,\\' creating a direct contradiction with the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact specifies need to \\'continue and re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy\\'. 2. Hospital summary documents antibiotic therapy as Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam) for cholangitis and wound infection. 3. No mention of Augmentin (amoxicillin clavulanate) in medications administered or discharge plans. 4. Continuing Augmentin cannot occur if it was never initiated, creating a direct contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 22, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** patient should follow up with Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/ Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Poultsides, George, MD in in 2 weeks\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact specifies follow up with APP in 1 week and Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. 2. Summary\\'s discharge plans mention follow ups with Gastroenterology, Hematology/Oncology (Dr. Butler), SLP, Nutrition, and primary care/surgery team. 3. No reference to APP or Dr. Poultsides in any follow up instructions. 4. Direct conflict exists between stated required follow up providers (APP/Poultsides) vs documented providers (Butler/others).\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 26, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Metoprolol dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily for improved rate control; Apixaban dosage increased to 5 mg twice daily for anticoagulation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that \\'Metoprolol increased to 75 mg BID\\' and \\'Apixaban continued at 5 mg BID\\', which matches the Important Fact that \\'Metoprolol dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily for improved rate control; Apixaban dosage increased to 5 mg twice daily for anticoagulation.\\' However, the summary indicates Apixaban was \\'continued\\' at 5 mg BID, not \\'increased\\' to it. This discrepancy suggests the summary and the fact are not entirely consistent regarding the Apixaban dosage adjustment.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states Apixaban dosage was \\'increased\\' to 5 mg BID. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s Medications section lists \\'Apixaban continued at 5 mg BID\\' without mentioning a dose increase. 3. \\'Continued\\' implies no change from prior dosage, conflicting with the \\'increased\\' claim in the Fact. 4. Metoprolol increase to 75 mg BID is correctly documented in both sources, but Apixaban discrepancy remains unresolved.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions CT findings of \\'moderate narrowing of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA)\\' which aligns with the fact about SMA stenosis 2. However, the summary explicitly states \\'no acute mesenteric ischemia\\' in the CT findings 3. The patient\\'s symptoms (nausea, vomiting) are attributed to other causes in the summary: Gastroparesis (listed as a secondary diagnosis) Type 2 Diabetes complications Hypovolemia 4. While SMA stenosis is present in both the fact and summary, the summary does not support chronic mesenteric ischemia as the cause of emesis\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia due to SMA stenosis. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s CT findings confirm SMA stenosis but explicitly state \\'no acute mesenteric ischemia\\'. 3. Summary attributes vomiting resolution to gastroparesis management (PPIs, dietary changes) and hypovolemia correction, with no mention of chronic mesenteric ischemia as a contributor. 4. Chronic mesenteric ischemia (distinct from acute) is not addressed in diagnoses or treatment plans, creating a conflict with the proposed etiology in the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states bacteremia was caused by coagulase negative strep . 2. Hospital Summary lists \\'Coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) bacteremia\\' in Secondary Diagnoses (Section 5). 3. CoNS (Staphylococcus) and coagulase negative Streptococcus are distinct organisms. Both cannot be true simultaneously. 4. Summary explicitly identifies Staphylococcus, directly conflicting with the Streptococcus claim in the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 27, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions \\'possible tonsillitis\\' and \\'mild tonsillar enlargement\\' on CT maxillofacial imaging 2. However, the summary does not indicate that tonsillitis was definitively diagnosed or that antibiotics were specifically prescribed for tonsillitis 3. While antibiotics were given, they were primarily for neutropenic fever and CoNS bacteremia 4. The fact states tonsillitis was diagnosed and treated with antibiotics, which contradicts the summary\\'s characterization of tonsillitis as only \\'possible\\' and not a primary reason for treatment\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows bilirubin did improve (from 17.6 mg/dL to 10.8 mg/dL), which contradicts the fact stating \\'Bilirubin did not improve.\\' 2. However, both the summary and the fact agree that the patient transitioned to home hospice care. 3. Given that one part of the statement is contradicted (bilirubin improvement), while the other part is consistent (hospice transition), we must flag this as inconsistent since both parts of the fact must be true for consistency.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that total bilirubin decreased from 17.6 mg/dL to 10.8 mg/dL during admission, suggesting an improvement. This contradicts the Important Fact that states \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange.\\' The summary also mentions \\'Persistent but reducing hyperbilirubinemia\\' under Problem #1, further indicating some level of improvement in bilirubin levels. Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange. 2. Hospital summary shows total bilirubin decreased from 17.6 mg/dL to 10.8 mg/dL post PTBD. 3. Problem #1 explicitly notes \\'reducing hyperbilirubinemia\\'. 4. These improvements directly conflict with the assertion that bilirubin didn\\'t improve after PTBD.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis: Summary mentions piperacillin tazobactam for possible cholangitis but never documents sepsis diagnosis or fluid resuscitation. 2. Delirium pharmacotherapy: Summary states delirium was \\'managed with supportive care\\' (Problem #6), with mirtazapine/melatonin listed for sleep/mood no antipsychotics or specific delirium medications documented. 3. Urinary retention: Flomax is listed for urinary output management, but no documentation of urinary catheter placement or retention diagnosis.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 29, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt w/ metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma admitted for dysphagia and weight loss treated w/ PEG and tube feeding and strict NPO.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states patient was on strict NPO. 2. Hospital summary\\'s \\'Therapeutic Procedures\\' section notes \\'ice chip trials\\' during speech therapy. 3. Strict NPO typically prohibits all oral intake including ice chips. 4. Ice chip trials directly contradict strict NPO status.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states management was deferred due to patient\\'s delirium and son\\'s wishes. 2. Hospital Summary (Problem #6) documents delirium as \\'resolved\\' at discharge. 3. Summary\\'s Discharge Plan for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Problem #1) states \\'outpatient oncologic follow up\\' but does not mention deferral due to delirium or family preferences. 4. Resolution of delirium in summary conflicts with delirium being an active reason for deferral in the fact, creating inconsistency.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Presence of important facts\\n\\n**Score: 68/100** (95% CI: 58-77) (higher values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the important facts missing:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries frequently omit critical clinical facts due to recurring patterns: (1) Incomplete procedural documentation, where key surgical steps (e.g., adhesiolysis in Patient 2’s bowel resection) or specific medication regimens (e.g., Lantus 15U BID vs. documented Levemir 16U BID in Patient 6) are excluded. (2) Partial recovery documentation, such as noting flatus but omitting bowel movements (Patient 2) or resolving AKI without addressing persistent hypokalemia (Patient 18). (3) Implied causation without explicit linkage, as seen in adrenal crisis attributed to prednisone intolerance (Patient 6) or hospice transition despite improving bilirubin (Patient 28). (4) Discharge plan ambiguities, including unspecified follow-up timelines (Patient 12’s TPN) or undocumented medication transitions (apixaban to Lovenox in Patient 7). (5) Diagnostic omissions, such as excluding viral gastroenteritis as a principal diagnosis (Patient 15) or failing to specify pulmonary infection suspicion (Patient 18). Additionally, temporal discrepancies (e.g., PTBD exchange date mismatch in Patient 28) and incomplete microbiology reporting (missing ESBL E. coli/Klebsiella in Patient 19’s UTI) further highlight systemic gaps in explicitly connecting clinical data to management decisions.\\n\\n### B. Hospital course summaries contradicting important facts\\n\\n**Score: 18/100** (95% CI: 11-26) (lower values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the inconsistencies:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries frequently exhibit inconsistencies with clinical facts due to recurring patterns of documentation errors, misinterpretations, and omissions. Common failure modes include: (1) **Medication regimen discrepancies** (Patient 6: Levemir vs. Lantus insulin type/dose conflict; Patient 7: Lovenox discharge plan vs. apixaban continuation claim; Patient 20: Fondaparinux-to-apixaban transition misrepresented as initiation), (2) **Omission of critical events/results** (Patient 8: undocumented aspiration event and unreported GPC-positive blood cultures; Patient 24: discharge claimed despite ongoing SBO hospitalization), (3) **Diagnostic/treatment misattribution** (Patient 15: viral gastroenteritis diagnosis unsupported by esophagitis/AKI findings; Patient 27: Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus mislabeled as \"strep\"), (4) **Temporal inconsistencies** (Patient 28: PTBD exchange date [4/8 vs. 4/21] and bilirubin improvement mischaracterization), and (5) **Contradictory clinical assessments** (Patient 13: \"unremarkable\" post-op course vs. documented complications; Patient 18: unresolved hypokalemia labeled as resolved). These errors often stem from incomplete data synthesis, terminology confusion (e.g., basal insulin types), and failure to reconcile evolving treatment plans with final documentation.\\n\\n## Detailed results\\n\\n### A.

All Missing Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 0, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left-sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I found several references to the left JP drain status: 1. The brief description mentions \\'the Left JP drain remained with normal amylase and decreasing output\\' 2. Under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' it states \\'Finalize plan for Left JP drain (removal prior to discharge or outpatient management)\\' 3. In Problem #1\\'s Current Clinical Status section, it notes \\'Left JP drain with translucent fluid, decreasing output\\' 4. The decision about the Left JP drain is listed as pending under Outstanding/Pending Issues as \\'Decision regarding removal of Left JP drain (pre discharge or outpatient)\\' While the summary clearly indicates the presence of a left JP drain and discusses the pending decision about its management, it does not explicitly state that the drain was left in place at discharge. The fact that it\\'s listed as a pending decision suggests this was still undetermined at the time the summary was written.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 1, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypoxia 2/2 recurrent R pleura effusion\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions both hypoxia and recurrent right pleural effusion. Hypoxia is documented in multiple sections (e.g., \\'remained hypoxic on room air\\' in the Brief Description and Problem #1/Problem #3). The recurrent right pleural effusion is clearly stated as an ongoing issue. However, the summary does not explicitly link hypoxia to the effusion using terms like \\'secondary to,\\' \\'due to,\\' or equivalent phrasing. While hypoxia and the effusion are contextually related (e.g., hypoxia noted post drainage), causation is not directly stated. The hypoxemia is also attributed to OSA in Problem #3, creating ambiguity. Since the fact requires explicit attribution (hypoxia 2/2 effusion) and no such causal link is definitively made, the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 2, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed. Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step: 1. The hospital course mentions a \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' was performed on 04/23/2023. 2. The surgery was performed for a \\'necrotic mass causing nausea and vomiting\\'. 3. However, while the summary mentions the procedure and the presence of a necrotic mass, it does not explicitly state that adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down. 4. The specific details of the surgical procedure (taking down adhesions, removing obstructing mass) are not described in the hospital course summary. 5. While we can infer that the necrotic mass was removed during the surgery, the exact surgical steps and findings are not explicitly detailed in this summary. 6. The fact we\\'re looking for contains specific surgical details (adhesiolysis between omentum and abdominal wall) that are simply not mentioned in this post operative summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient underwent a \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis on 04/23/2023 for a necrotic mass causing nausea and vomiting.\\' This information is found under the \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' and is further detailed under \\'Problem #1: New Small Bowel Mass, concerning for Metastatic Sarcoma\\' in the \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' section. The fact that adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down and obstructing necrotic masses were removed is not explicitly mentioned in the summary. However, the summary does confirm that a laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed, which aligns with the key elements of the fact in question.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' performed for a \\'necrotic mass,\\' which directly addresses the second part of the fact. However, there is no mention of adhesions between the omentum and abdominal wall being taken down. The summary describes the resection of the mass and the procedure but does not include any reference to adhesiolysis or manipulation of omental adhesions. Since the necrotic mass removal and small bowel resection are confirmed, but the adhesion takedown is absent, the fact as a whole is not fully stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 2, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient recovered from surgery well; had flatus and bowel movement \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact about recovery and bowel function is explicitly mentioned in several places in the summary: 1. The summary states \\'her pain improved after passing flatus\\' in the initial description and again under Problem #1\\'s Current Clinical Status. 2. Under Problem #2\\'s Current Clinical Status, it specifically mentions \\'Passed flatus.\\' 3. The patient is described as \\'doing well\\' on Post Operative Day 3 and is tolerating a Post Surgical Step 2 diet without nausea or vomiting. However, while flatus is explicitly mentioned, there is no specific mention of a bowel movement occurring. Since the fact we\\'re looking for requires both flatus AND bowel movement, and only flatus is documented, we cannot confirm the complete fact is present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states that the patient \\'reported as \"doing well\"\\' post operatively and mentions \\'flatus\\' in two contexts: \\'Pain improved after passing flatus\\' (Problem #1) and \\'Passed flatus\\' (Problem #2). However, the summary does not explicitly mention a bowel movement. While tolerating a diet and passing flatus indicate improving bowel function, the specific term \\'bowel movement\\' or an unambiguous synonym (e.g., \\'defecation\\') is absent. The presence of a bowel regimen (senna, MiraLAX) suggests management but does not confirm the occurrence of a bowel movement. Since the fact requires both flatus and bowel movement, and only flatus is documented, the fact is not fully stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 3, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** LLQ abdominal pain 2/2 cancer\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'recurrent LLQ abdominal pain\\' in the one liner and describes a \\'new episode of LLQ abdominal pain\\' in the chronic pain section. However, the attribution of LLQ pain to cancer (2/2 cancer) is not explicitly stated. While the patient has stage IV sigmoid adenocarcinoma with metastases, the text does not link the LLQ pain directly to cancer etiology. The CT abdomen/pelvis (09/16/2023) found no acute intra abdominal source for the pain flare, and the summary attributes chronic pain to bony metastases\\' but does not specify cancer as the cause of the LLQ pain. The absence of a direct statement or equivalent phrasing (e.g., \\'cancer related,\\' \\'metastatic pain\\') means the causal link is implied but not explicitly documented as per the guidelines.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details a 19 year old female patient with Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2, including Primary Adrenal Insufficiency, admitted for adrenal crisis. The summary indicates that the patient was on prednisone 2.5 mg BID at home. Upon admission for adrenal crisis, she was treated with stress dose hydrocortisone, which was later tapered. The document highlights that the patient had nausea and vomiting upon admission, which resolved by 01/21/2023. While it doesn\\'t directly state that the adrenal crisis was due to intolerance of PO prednisone, it implies that the nausea and vomiting could have contributed to the adrenal crisis. The summary does not explicitly mention that the adrenal crisis was likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. However, it provides enough context to infer a potential link between the patient\\'s symptoms (nausea and vomiting) and the adrenal crisis. Despite this, the specific fact that the adrenal crisis was \\'likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone\\' is not directly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states that the patient has primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2 and was admitted for adrenal crisis. However, the summary does not explicitly mention that the adrenal crisis was \\'likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone.\\' While malabsorption is being investigated (which could theoretically relate to oral medication absorption), the text does not directly attribute the crisis to prednisone intolerance. The summary describes her home prednisone regimen and the transition to hydrocortisone during hospitalization but does not state intolerance as a causative factor. The adrenal crisis is presented in the context of her underlying APS Type 2 without specifying this particular etiology.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that while Type 1 diabetes is mentioned multiple times, the specific insulin change to Lantus 15 units twice daily is not explicitly stated. The summary mentions different insulin regimens: 1. Initially, the patient was on IV insulin infusion 2. This was transitioned to \\'Levemir 16 units BID, mealtime lispro 1 unit per 7g carbohydrates, high sensitivity correction scale\\' by 01/24/2023 3. The patient\\'s home regimen was noted as \\'Basaglar 25 units daily\\' Nowhere in the text is there any mention of Lantus or a change to 15 units twice daily. While insulin adjustments were clearly made during the hospitalization, this specific change is not documented in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the management of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) under Problem #3. It states that the patient was transitioned from an IV insulin infusion to a subcutaneous insulin regimen consisting of \\'Levemir 16 units BID, mealtime lispro 1 unit per 7g carbohydrates, high sensitivity correction scale\\' by 01/24/2023. The fact to be verified is \\'Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\' Lantus is a brand name for insulin glargine, which is different from Levemir (insulin detemir). The summary does not mention Lantus or the specific dosage of 15 units twice a day. Therefore, the exact fact mentioned is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly details the patient\\'s T1DM management. Under Problem #3 (T1DM), it states the insulin regimen was changed to \\'Levemir 16 units BID\\' with mealtime lispro. The fact in question specifies \\'Lantus 15 units twice a day.\\' While both Levemir and Lantus are long acting insulins, they are distinct medications (insulin detemir vs. glargine). The documented dose (16 units BID) differs from the 15 units specified. No mention of Lantus or equivalent terminology exists in the summary. The specific fact (medication name and exact dose) is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 7, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left renal cell carcinoma status-post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post-op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'left renal cell carcinoma\\' and \\'left radical nephrectomy with IVC thrombectomy,\\' aligning with the fact. However, the neoadjuvant therapy is specified as \\'cabozantinib,\\' a targeted therapy, not chemotherapy. Since \\'chemotherapy\\' is not mentioned in any form (including synonyms or abbreviations) and the summary explicitly names a non chemotherapy agent, the \\'neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\' component of the fact is absent. The fact requires both nephrectomy/IVC thrombectomy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy to be present. While the surgical components are documented, the specific mention of chemotherapy is missing, making the full fact unstated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 7, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second-line\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of a hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo (ipilimumab/nivolumab) or a switch to cabozantinib due to such a reaction. While cabozantinib is mentioned in the summary (specifically in Problem #1 as \\'Home therapy (cabozantinib) held perioperatively\\' and in the Relevant Medical History as \\'neoadjuvant therapy (cabozantinib, held perioperatively)\\'), it is only described as a treatment that was temporarily held for surgery. There is no mention of ipilimumab/nivolumab anywhere in the text, nor any description of a hypersensitivity reaction that led to a therapy switch. The summary discusses cabozantinib as an existing treatment but does not provide information about how or why it was initially chosen as therapy.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission and treatment. The patient was diagnosed with left renal cell carcinoma and underwent a left radical nephrectomy with IVC thrombectomy. The summary mentions that the patient was on cabozantinib as part of their neoadjuvant therapy for renal cell carcinoma, which was held perioperatively. However, there is no mention of the patient being treated with ipi/nivo (ipilimumab/nivolumab) or experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction to it. The summary does discuss the resumption of cabozantinib as part of the discharge plan under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' and \\'Problem #1\\', indicating it was stopped during the perioperative period and its resumption was to be determined by oncology.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) Searched for mentions of ipilimumab/nivolumab (ipi/nivo) neither drug name nor their common abbreviations appear in the summary. 2) Looked for hypersensitivity reactions while transaminitis is documented, it\\'s attributed to post operative causes rather than drug reaction. 3) Cabozantinib is mentioned as being held perioperatively and considered for resumption, but this is framed as continuation of prior neoadjuvant therapy rather than a new second line therapy. 4) No documentation of immunotherapy agents being discontinued due to adverse reaction. 5) The switch to cabozantinib appears to reflect standard perioperative management rather than a therapeutic change due to hypersensitivity. The summary contains no explicit mention of immunotherapy agents or hypersensitivity reactions to them.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 7, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Continued on apixaban post-op\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I find that while apixaban is mentioned as part of the patient\\'s history and there is discussion of anticoagulation planning, the summary does not explicitly state that the patient was continued on apixaban post operatively. In fact, the summary indicates the opposite: 1. The patient was discharged on Lovenox (enoxaparin), not apixaban 2. Under Problem #6 (VTE Prophylaxis), it specifically mentions \\'Discharged on Lovenox (enoxaparin)\\' 3. In the Outstanding Issues section, it notes \\'Determination of definitive long term anticoagulation plan (duration of Lovenox therapy and plan for transition to/reassessment for apixaban)\\' 4. The summary indicates that home apixaban was held perioperatively, and there is no mention of its resumption This clearly shows that the patient was not continued on apixaban post operatively, but rather was on a different anticoagulation regimen with future plans to potentially transition back to apixaban.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient was discharged on Lovenox (enoxaparin) and that there is a plan for \\'determination of definitive long term anticoagulation plan (duration of Lovenox therapy and plan for transition to/reassessment for apixaban)\\' as part of the outstanding issues. This indicates that while apixaban was not continued at discharge, there is a plan to reassess or transition to it post discharge, implying that apixaban was stopped during the hospital stay and was not continued post op at discharge but is being considered for the future.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states that the patient was discharged on Lovenox (enoxaparin) for VTE prophylaxis, with plans to determine a long term anticoagulation plan including a potential transition to or reassessment for apixaban. However, the summary does not mention that the patient was continued on apixaban post operatively. Instead, it specifies that apixaban (Eliquis) was part of the patient\\'s pre operative regimen (held perioperatively) and that its resumption is pending outpatient follow up. The discharge medication list includes Lovenox, not apixaban. The phrase \\'continued on apixaban post op\\' is not explicitly stated, as the transition to apixaban remains a future consideration rather than an implemented action during the hospitalization.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, the specific fact about a potential aspiration event prior to discharge with 1/4 bottles positive for GPC and incomplete speciation is not explicitly mentioned. While there are several related elements in the summary: 1) An initial chest X ray on 06/09/2023 showed \\'Patchy left basilar opacity, suggestive of pneumonia/aspiration\\', 2) Blood cultures from 06/09/2023 are mentioned with \\'No growth to date\\', and 3) A fever was noted on 06/17/2023 prior to discharge, there is no specific mention of: a) a potential aspiration event just before discharge, b) 1/4 bottles being positive for GPC, or c) incomplete speciation of cultures at discharge. The closest related information is about the earlier admission blood cultures showing no growth, but this is different from the specific fact being sought.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about Mr. Violette\\'s hospitalization and treatment. To determine if the fact \\'Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\' is mentioned, we need to examine the summary for relevant information. The summary includes various sections detailing the patient\\'s hospital course, diagnostic investigations, and therapeutic procedures. Under \\'Problem #1: Community Acquired Pneumonia (Left Lower Lobe)\\', it is mentioned that the Chest X ray on 06/09/2023 was \\'suggestive of pneumonia/aspiration\\'. However, there is no direct mention of a \\'potential aspiration event prior to discharge\\'. The summary does detail that the patient had a sputum culture on 06/10/2023, which showed \\'1+ Staphylococcus aureus with other mixed respiratory flora\\', but it does not specify the results of blood cultures or mention \\'1/4 bottles positive for GPC\\'. The fact about a potential aspiration event and the specific microbiology results are not explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) The fact requires three components: aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, and incomplete speciation. 2) The chest X ray on admission mentions possible aspiration, but no aspiration event is documented near discharge. 3) The sputum culture showed 1+ Staphylococcus aureus (GPC), but this was reported on 06/10 and speciated, not left pending. Blood cultures showed no growth. 4) The urine culture had Staphylococcus species (GPC at genus level), but this relates to UTI, not respiratory, and was not described as \\'1/4 bottles.\\' 5) No documentation of incomplete speciation for respiratory cultures at discharge. While some elements are peripherally related (e.g., historical aspiration risk), none of the three specific components are explicitly stated together as per the fact\\'s wording.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the key components of the fact we\\'re looking for: 1. Sepsis from urinary source with pyelonephritis CONFIRMED: The summary explicitly states \\'sepsis secondary to a complicated urinary tract infection... with developing pyelonephritis\\' 2. 7 day course of cipro on discharge NOT MENTIONED: While the summary discusses antibiotics (Vancomycin, Duluth, Zosyn), it only mentions a plan to \\'transition to an appropriate course of oral antibiotics (guided by pending urine culture sensitivities)\\'. Ciprofloxacin and a 7 day duration are not specifically mentioned. 3. Started on finasteride to prevent future UTIs PARTIALLY CONFIRMED: The summary confirms finasteride was started (on 07/26/2023), but it states this was \\'for prostatomegaly\\' rather than explicitly for UTI prevention. Since a key component (7 day cipro course) is not mentioned and the stated purpose of finasteride differs from what we\\'re looking for, we cannot say this specific fact combination is explicitly present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details a patient admitted with sepsis secondary to a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) with developing pyelonephritis and contributing prostatomegaly. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics and Finasteride was initiated for prostatomegaly. The summary explicitly mentions sepsis from a urinary source with potential pyelonephritis and the initiation of Finasteride to address prostatomegaly, which is related to preventing future UTIs. However, it does not explicitly state that the patient was finishing a 7 day course of Cipro on discharge; instead, it mentions that the patient was to transition to an appropriate course of oral antibiotics guided by pending urine culture sensitivities. Thus, the specific fact about \\'finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge\\' is not mentioned. The summary does confirm the initiation of Finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course explicitly mentions sepsis from a urinary source (complicated UTI) with developing pyelonephritis, satisfying the first part of the fact. However, the summary does not mention a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin at discharge—instead, oral antibiotics are pending culture sensitivities. Finasteride is documented as initiated for prostatomegaly, not explicitly for UTI prevention. While finasteride may indirectly reduce UTI risk by addressing prostate enlargement, the stated purpose in the text is anatomical management, not UTI prophylaxis. Since the ciprofloxacin component is absent and the finasteride rationale differs from the fact’s wording, the fact as a whole is not fully addressed.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 9, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling, DVT US negative, unclear etiology \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'Right upper extremity\\' and \\'left lower extremity swelling\\' under Problem #4. It states that DVT ultrasounds for these extremities were negative. However, the summary does not explicitly state that the etiology of the swelling is unclear. While the negative DVT results and lack of identified cause might imply an unclear etiology, the text does not use terms like \\'unclear etiology,\\' \\'unknown cause,\\' or equivalent clinical phrases. The discharge plan only mentions addressing residual swelling symptomatically without further investigation, which suggests but does not explicitly state uncertainty in etiology. Therefore, the specific fact as phrased (including all three components) is not fully present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 12, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was started on empiric antibiotics but was found to have a normal WBC with normal lactate and abx were discontinued, he was not discharged on antibiotics\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary for mentions of empiric antibiotics, WBC counts, lactate levels, and antibiotic discontinuation. Here\\'s my analysis: 1. WBC counts are mentioned: Initial WBC was 8.4 x10³/µL on 03/16, decreasing to 5.1 x10³/µL on 03/18 (both normal range) 2. However, there is no mention of: Starting empiric antibiotics Lactate levels Discontinuing antibiotics Discharge antibiotic status While the summary mentions \\'pending infectious workup (blood cultures, urinalysis)\\' in the Outstanding Issues section, it does not discuss any antibiotic treatment decisions. Given that this specific sequence of events (starting antibiotics, normal WBC/lactate leading to discontinuation, no discharge antibiotics) is not explicitly mentioned in any form, this fact is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, treatment, and discharge. To determine if the fact \\'He was started on empiric antibiotics but was found to have a normal WBC with normal lactate and abx were discontinued, he was not discharged on antibiotics\\' is mentioned, we need to look for relevant information regarding antibiotic use, WBC count, lactate levels, and discharge medication. The summary mentions that the patient\\'s WBC count decreased from 8.4 to 5.1 x10³/µL, indicating a normal WBC count by the end of the admission. However, there is no explicit mention of empiric antibiotics being started, lactate levels, or the discontinuation of antibiotics. The summary does list \\'pending infectious workup (e.g., blood cultures, urinalysis)\\' under outstanding issues, suggesting that infection was a consideration, but it does not directly state that antibiotics were used or discontinued due to normal WBC and lactate. Therefore, the specific fact about starting, discontinuing antibiotics due to normal lab values, and not being discharged on them is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly state that empiric antibiotics were started and then discontinued due to normal WBC and lactate. While the WBC is mentioned (decreasing from 8.4 to 5.1 x10³/µL, which is within the normal range), there is no mention of lactate levels or any reference to antibiotics being initiated or discontinued. The therapeutic interventions listed under all problem sections (IV fluids, norepinephrine, TPN adjustments, etc.) do not include antibiotics. The \\'Outstanding Issues\\' mention pending infectious workup (blood cultures, urinalysis), but this does not confirm antibiotic administration or discontinuation. Since the summary lacks any direct reference to antibiotics being started, stopped, or their relation to lab values, the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 12, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was discharged on TPN with instructions to follow up in 4 weeks  \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Analyzing the summary step by step: 1. The discharge plan is detailed in multiple sections, particularly under \\'Problem #3\\' in the discharge plan and goals. 2. The summary explicitly states that the patient was discharged home on 03/19 with TPN via Soleo Health. 3. However, while follow up with Dr. Schipper\\'s office and attending physicians is mentioned, there is no specific mention of a 4 week follow up timeframe. 4. The summary states \\'Follow up with Dr. Schipper\\'s office and attendings\\' but does not specify the timing of this follow up. 5. Since the fact requires both TPN at discharge (which is mentioned) AND a specific 4 week follow up instruction (which is not mentioned), we cannot consider this fact as fully present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary indicates that the patient was discharged home on 03/19/2024 with arrangements for Home Infusion Therapy via Soleo Health for TPN. The discharge plan included instructions for the patient to continue limited clear liquids with cyclic TPN and to follow up with Dr. Schipper\\'s office and other attending physicians. Although the exact timing of the follow up is not specified in the provided summary under the \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' section, it is mentioned in the \\'Problem #3: Complicated Post Surgical Status\\' section that the patient was to follow up with Dr. Schipper\\'s office and attendings. The summary does not explicitly state \\'follow up in 4 weeks\\'.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient was discharged on TPN (mentioned in multiple sections including \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' and \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\'). However, the specific instruction to \\'follow up in 4 weeks\\' is not found in the text. While follow up with Dr. Schipper\\'s office and other physicians is mentioned, no timeframe (e.g., 4 weeks) is provided for this follow up. The summary discusses pending issues and outpatient follow up generally but does not specify a 4 week interval.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the key elements of the fact we\\'re looking for: 1. Patient with breast cancer Confirmed in summary: patient has inflammatory breast cancer 2. Admitted for bilateral mastectomy Confirmed: \\'underwent bilateral complete mastectomies and right axillary lymph node dissection on 06/21/2023\\' 3. Unremarkable post operative course Largely confirmed: Despite some manageable issues (pain management, elevated lidocaine level that was addressed, HTN, and glucose management), the summary repeatedly states the patient was \\'doing well postoperatively\\' and \\'recovering well overall\\'. The surgical site remained \\'clean, dry, and intact\\' throughout. 4. Discharge home While discharge planning is discussed, there is no explicit mention of the patient actually being discharged home in this summary, which appears to end while the patient is still hospitalized on POD#4 (06/25/2023). Since the actual discharge home is not explicitly mentioned in the summary, despite all other elements being present, we must mark this as not fully mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient underwent bilateral mastectomies for breast cancer. However, the postoperative course is described with multiple complications (lidocaine toxicity, panic attack, hypertension, hyperglycemia, skin blistering), which contradict an \\'unremarkable\\' course. While phrases like \\'recovering well overall\\' and \\'doing well postoperatively\\' are present, these do not equate to an explicitly \\'unremarkable\\' course in the context of documented adverse events. Additionally, the summary does not explicitly state the patient was discharged home; it only outlines discharge plans as of 06/25/2023 without confirming actual discharge. Thus, the full fact (including all three components) is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary to determine if it explicitly states that her chronic medical conditions, including DM2, were not worsened perioperatively. Here\\'s my analysis: 1. Regarding DM2 specifically: The summary shows her glucose levels remained elevated during admission Her insulin sliding scale needed to be increased to \\'moderate\\' This suggests some worsening of glycemic control 2. For other chronic conditions: Her blood pressure remained elevated during admission She experienced anxiety/panic attack 3. Most importantly: Nowhere in the text does it explicitly state that her chronic conditions, including DM2, were stable or not worsened In fact, the evidence suggests some perioperative challenges with glycemic control 4. The statement we\\'re looking for would need to indicate stability or lack of worsening of chronic conditions, but no such statement exists in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s postoperative recovery and management of various medical conditions. Under \\'Problem #5: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,\\' it is noted that the patient\\'s glucose levels remained elevated during the hospital stay, with values such as 245 mg/dL, 206 mg/dL on 06/24/2023, and 231 mg/dL on 06/25/2023. The insulin sliding scale was increased to \\'moderate\\' to manage the hyperglycemia. There is no explicit mention that her chronic medical conditions, including DM2, were worsened perioperatively. Instead, the summary indicates active management of her glucose levels and other conditions without stating they were worsened.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions management of the patient\\'s type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) with elevated glucose levels requiring an increased insulin sliding scale. However, there is no explicit statement indicating whether her DM2 or other chronic conditions were \\'worsened perioperatively.\\' The text documents adjustments in management (e.g., insulin titration, antihypertensive continuation) but does not characterize these as deteriorations of her baseline conditions. While hyperglycemia and hypertension persisted, the summary frames these as expected challenges requiring ongoing management rather than explicit worsening. No language directly addresses stability or exacerbation of chronic conditions in the perioperative context.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of viral gastroenteritis as the principal discharge diagnosis. While the patient presented with symptoms that could be consistent with viral gastroenteritis (nausea, vomiting), and the clinical course showed improvement with supportive care and discontinuation of empiric antibiotics, the summary does not specifically state this as the principal or final diagnosis. The summary discusses multiple possible etiologies for the patient\\'s symptoms, including possible esophagitis (noted on CT scan), but never definitively labels the condition as viral gastroenteritis. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' lists the presenting symptoms under \\'Problem #1: Nausea, Vomiting, and Hypotension\\' but does not specify viral gastroenteritis as the final diagnosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' as the principal diagnosis at discharge. The summary details the patient\\'s admission for severe nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and subsequent acute kidney injury (AKI), and various diagnostic evaluations and management strategies. The symptoms of nausea and vomiting are attributed to possible esophagitis based on a CT scan finding of lower esophageal wall thickening. While the patient presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, there is no clear statement or indication that viral gastroenteritis was considered or diagnosed during the hospital stay.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' as the principal diagnosis at discharge. The patient was admitted for nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and AKI, with diagnostic workup suggesting possible esophagitis (via CT findings of esophageal wall thickening) and attributing AKI to Acute Tubular Necrosis. While infection was considered (leading to empiric antibiotics), the summary emphasizes resolution of GI symptoms with hydration and discontinuation of antibiotics due to low suspicion for infection. The discharge plan focuses on esophagitis evaluation and AKI follow up, but no direct reference to viral gastroenteritis as the principal diagnosis is made in any section, including problem lists or discharge summaries.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact of \\'persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\' is partially present but not fully aligned with the text. Here\\'s the analysis: 1. Persistent fever is clearly documented (recurrent to 100.9°F overnight into 08/06) 2. Multiple negative infectious workups are documented, including: Negative blood cultures Negative urine analyses Negative respiratory viral panel Low procalcitonin Negative MRSA screen 3. However, there is no clear indication of suspected pulmonary infection specifically: Initial chest X ray showed only bibasilar atelectasis, no consolidation CT chest results are pending While empiric antibiotics were continued, the summary suggests consideration of non infectious causes like tumor fever or methotrexate toxicity No explicit mention of suspected pulmonary source While fever and negative workups are present, the specific suspicion of pulmonary infection is not explicitly stated in the text. Therefore, the complete fact as stated is not present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions a persistent fever (recurrent to 100.9°F) and documents multiple negative infectious workups (blood cultures, urine analysis, respiratory viral panel, chest X ray without consolidation, CT abdomen/pelvis). However, while pulmonary infection is indirectly considered (e.g., pending CT chest, empiric Cefepime coverage for potential respiratory pathogens), the text does not explicitly state that a pulmonary infection was specifically suspected. The summary emphasizes that no definitive infectious source was identified and raises non infectious etiologies (e.g., tumor fever). The fever is clearly persistent, and infectious workups are negative, but the \\'suspected pulmonary infection\\' component is not directly articulated in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 18, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact \\'Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\' is partially but not completely accurate based on the hospital course summary. Let\\'s break down the components: 1. The AKI did resolve during admission this is explicitly stated in Problem #3 where it notes \\'AKI resolved (Cr 0.52 mg/dL on 08/06)\\' and shows improvement from admission Cr of 0.80 mg/dL to 0.52 mg/dL. 2. However, the hypokalemia did NOT resolve the summary specifically states \\'Mild hypokalemia persisted (K 3.3 mmol/L on 08/06) despite supplementation\\' and lists \\'Complete normalization of serum potassium\\' as an outstanding issue. Since the fact requires BOTH the AKI AND hypokalemia to resolve, and only the AKI resolved while hypokalemia persisted, the complete fact as stated is not explicitly present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient had Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) upon admission, which resolved during the hospital stay. It also mentions that the patient had hypokalemia, which persisted at discharge, though it is described as mild. The serum creatinine improved from 0.80 mg/dL on admission to 0.52 mg/dL by 08/06, indicating resolution of AKI. The serum potassium was 3.4 mmol/L on admission and remained low at 3.3 mmol/L on 08/06, indicating persistent mild hypokalemia. Thus, while AKI resolved, hypokalemia did not fully resolve during admission.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states under Problem #3 (Acute Kidney Injury and Hypokalemia) that \\'AKI resolved (Cr 0.52 mg/dL on 08/06)\\' and separately notes \\'mild hypokalemia persisted (K 3.3 mmol/L on 08/06)\\'. While the AKI resolution is clearly documented, hypokalemia is explicitly described as persistent rather than resolved. The key fact requires both AKI and hypokalemia to have resolved, but the text specifically indicates hypokalemia remained unresolved despite treatment. Therefore, the combined resolution of both conditions is not stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 19, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis).\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step to determine if hydronephrosis with UTIs (specifically ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis) is explicitly mentioned: 1. Hydronephrosis is mentioned in two places: In Problem #1 description: \\'mild bilateral hydroureteronephrosis\\' In Relevant Medical History: \\'Bilateral Hydronephrosis\\' 2. UTI is clearly present with Enterococcus faecalis: Problem #1 describes \\'Complicated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI)\\' Urine culture shows \\'Enterococcus faecalis\\' 3. However, there is no mention of: ESBL E. coli Klebsiella While the text confirms hydronephrosis and UTI with Enterococcus faecalis, it does not mention all the specific organisms (ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella) stated in the fact. Since the fact requires all three organisms to be present, and only one is mentioned, we cannot consider this fact as fully present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** Step 1: Identify references to hydronephrosis. The summary explicitly states \\'mild bilateral hydroureteronephrosis\\' in the CT findings (Problem #1). Step 2: Check for UTI complications. The admission was for a complicated UTI with Enterococcus faecalis confirmed in urine culture. Step 3: Evaluate for ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella mentions. While Enterococcus faecalis is explicitly identified, there is no documentation of ESBL E. coli or Klebsiella in urine cultures, blood cultures, or antibiotic resistance discussions. The text only specifies Enterococcus faecalis as the cultured organism. Conclusion: The fact requires all three pathogens (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterococcus) complicating hydronephrosis. Only Enterococcus faecalis is explicitly mentioned in this context, with no evidence of the other two pathogens.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\' is partially mentioned but not exactly as stated. Let\\'s break down the analysis: 1. Worsening thrombocytopenia is clearly documented: OSH platelet counts showed decline: 72,000/µL to 64,000/µL, with nadir of 42,000/µL on 05/11/2023 Described as \\'progressive thrombocytopenia\\' in the summary 2. Regarding prednisone: Patient was started on prednisone 40mg daily on 05/09/2023 Dose was increased to 100mg daily on 05/15/2023 However, there is no mention of a prednisone taper being initiated In fact, the summary specifically notes that \\'specific discharge plans regarding steroid regimen/taper... are not detailed in provided notes\\' While the worsening thrombocytopenia is clearly documented, and prednisone treatment is mentioned, there is no explicit mention of a prednisone taper being initiated. Therefore, the complete fact as stated is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s management for thrombocytopenia, including the initiation and increase of Prednisone. On 05/15/2023, Prednisone was increased to 100mg daily for presumed Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP). However, the summary does not explicitly mention a Prednisone taper initiation after the increase. It only mentions that there were \\'Specific discharge plans regarding steroid regimen/taper and further hematology follow up\\' that were not detailed in the provided notes. This indicates that while a taper was planned, it was not explicitly stated as having been initiated during the hospital stay described.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'progressive thrombocytopenia\\' in the admission context and provides platelet counts showing fluctuations (e.g., nadir of 42,000/µL on 05/11/2023, 67,000/µL on 05/12/2023, and 82,000/µL on 05/13/2023), which aligns with \\'worsening thrombocytopenia\\' as a clinical concern. 2. The summary states that prednisone was increased to 100mg daily on 05/15/2023 for ITP, but it does not explicitly mention the initiation of a prednisone taper . The discharge plan notes that \\'specific discharge plans for steroid tapering\\' were not detailed, and the follow up section refers to \\'establishing a long term steroid taper\\' as an outstanding issue. Since a taper initiation (s/p prednisone taper initiation) is not documented—only a dose increase and plans for future tapering—this component of the fact is absent.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 20, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the entire hospital course summary, focusing on discharge planning sections and follow up instructions. While there are multiple mentions of monitoring thrombocytopenia and the need for ongoing management, there is no explicit mention of ordering twice weekly CBCs after discharge. The discharge planning sections mention several specific items (continuing Apixaban, Prednisone, Pantoprazole, starting Atovaquone, using a walker, and considering Hepatitis B vaccination), but do not include any specific CBC monitoring schedule. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section mentions the need to \\'Monitor and manage thrombocytopenia\\' but does not specify the frequency of CBC monitoring. Given the patient\\'s condition, such monitoring would be clinically appropriate, but it is not explicitly documented in this summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s management plan during and after hospitalization. To determine if \\'Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\' is mentioned, we need to review the discharge plans and follow up instructions. The summary outlines various discharge medications and plans, including continuation of Apixaban, Prednisone, and Pantoprazole, as well as initiation of Atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis. However, it does not explicitly mention the frequency of CBC monitoring post discharge. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section highlights several pending investigations and the need to monitor thrombocytopenia, but it does not specify the frequency of CBC checks after discharge. Therefore, the fact \\'Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the provided summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed for any mention of \\'twice weekly CBCs after discharge.\\' The discharge planning sections under each problem and the \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' sections were reviewed. While thrombocytopenia monitoring and pending lab results are discussed, there is no explicit mention of CBCs being ordered at a twice weekly frequency post discharge. The summary references platelet count trends and pending investigations but does not specify CBC frequency for outpatient monitoring. The absence of this exact instruction or a clear synonym (e.g., \\'biweekly CBCs,\\' \\'CBC every 3 4 days\\') indicates the fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, particularly focusing on Problem #1 (Recurrent Falls and T6 Wedge Compression Fracture), I find that while recurrent falls are mentioned, the summary does not explicitly state that the falls remained of unknown etiology despite extensive workup. In fact, several potential contributing factors to the falls were identified: 1. Gait instability and walker hesitancy (reported by husband) 2. Possible cardiac contribution (runs of SVT noted on telemetry) 3. Cognitive issues (dementia noted as contributing to unsteadiness) 4. The summary describes specific diagnostic investigations including CT scans, telemetry monitoring, and physical therapy assessments that yielded findings rather than remaining inconclusive. While there was still some ongoing workup (e.g., pending pacemaker interrogation), the summary suggests that several likely contributing factors were identified rather than the falls remaining of unknown etiology despite extensive workup.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary, particularly focusing on Problem #1 which discusses the T6 wedge compression fracture. Here\\'s my analysis: 1. The summary mentions a \\'new T6 anterior wedge compression deformity\\' confirmed by CT on 03/14/2023 2. The word \\'new\\' suggests this is a recent finding 3. While the patient has a history of recurrent falls, there is no explicit mention or indication that this fracture predated the most recent fall 4. In fact, the fracture is consistently discussed in the context of the current admission and recent fall, suggesting it was a result of this event 5. No comparison imaging or historical documentation is mentioned that would suggest this was a pre existing condition 6. The temporal relationship described in the summary ties the fracture directly to the current admission for falls\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about Ms. Mallonee\\'s admission and treatment. Under Problem #1: Recurrent Falls and T6 Wedge Compression Fracture, it is stated that \\'CT Chest Abdomen Pelvis (03/14/2023) confirmed new T6 anterior wedge compression deformity.\\' The summary does not explicitly state that the T6 wedge compression fracture happened before the most recent fall. The language used suggests the fracture was associated with the recent falls, but it does not directly address the timing relative to \\'most recent fall.\\' However, the phrase \\'new T6 anterior wedge compression deformity\\' implies the fracture occurred around the time of or due to the recent falls, not necessarily before them. There is no explicit mention that the T6 wedge compression fracture likely happened before the most recent fall.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states that the T6 wedge compression fracture was confirmed by CT on 03/14/2023 (admission date) and attributes it to the \\'recurrent falls, culminating in a T6 compression fracture.\\' The term \\'culminating\\' implies the fracture resulted from the most recent fall. There is no mention of prior imaging, chronicity indicators (e.g., healing signs), or explicit clinical judgment suggesting the fracture predated the most recent fall. While \\'recurrent falls\\' indicates a history of falls, the fracture is consistently described as a new finding tied to the admission event. No synonyms, abbreviations, or contextual clues support a pre existing fracture unrelated to the recent fall.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 22, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find explicit mention of post procedural cholangitis following a recent biliary stent exchange. While the summary does mention cholangitis with E. coli bacteremia related to biliary drains, and there is mention of a biliary drain exchange on \\'12/24/2022 or 12/25/2022\\' in the surgical history, the temporal relationship between the drain exchange and the cholangitis is not explicitly stated as causal or sequential. The cholangitis is described as being \\'related to his percutaneous biliary drains\\' in general terms, but not specifically as a post procedural complication of the recent exchange. The admission date was 12/27/2022, which was shortly after the drain exchange, but the summary does not explicitly connect these events as cause and effect.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary to look for any mention of continuing or re evaluating augmentin therapy prior to a 14 day completion. The summary discusses antibiotic therapy in several places, specifically mentioning: 1. Intravenous piperacillin tazobactam being initiated and continued 2. A plan for \\'oral step down\\' antibiotics 3. Pending E. coli sensitivities from blood cultures 4. Need to \\'Finalize antibiotic plan\\' in the Outstanding Issues section However, nowhere in the summary is there any specific mention of augmentin therapy or its re evaluation prior to a 14 day completion. While antibiotic management is clearly an important aspect of the patient\\'s care, this specific detail about augmentin continuation and re evaluation is not explicitly stated in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s treatment for cholangitis with intravenous piperacillin tazobactam. Under \\'Problem #1: Cholangitis and Biliary Drain Complication,\\' it is mentioned that the plan is to \\'Complete prescribed course of intravenous piperacillin tazobactam, with plan for oral step down.\\' The specific fact to look for is \\'should continue and re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion.\\' The summary does not explicitly mention \\'Augmentin\\' (which is another name for amoxicillin clavulanate, a different antibiotic from piperacillin tazobactam) or a plan to re evaluate its continuation before 14 days. Piperacillin tazobactam is the antibiotic used, and there\\'s a plan for oral step down after its completion, but no mention of Augmentin or the specific duration reevaluation. Thus, the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions the use of intravenous piperacillin tazobactam for cholangitis and outlines a plan to complete the prescribed course with an oral step down. However, there is no mention of Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate) anywhere in the document. The antibiotic therapy discussed is piperacillin tazobactam, and while sensitivities for E. coli are pending, the summary does not reference a need to re evaluate Augmentin therapy specifically. Since Augmentin is not named or implied (e.g., via synonyms like \\'amoxicillin clavulanate\\'), the fact about continuing and re evaluating Augmentin prior to 14 day completion is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 22, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** patient should follow up with Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/ Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Poultsides, George, MD in in 2 weeks\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find any explicit mention of follow up appointments with an Advanced Practice Provider in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. While the summary includes multiple follow up recommendations with various specialists (including Interventional Radiology, Surgical Oncology, Speech Language Pathology, Gastroenterology, ENT, Registered Dietitian, primary oncologist Dr. Butler, and Radiation Oncology), none specifically mention the timing and providers specified in the fact we\\'re looking for. The closest mentions are follow up with Surgical Oncology (no specific timing given) and a Radiation Oncology appointment on 01/02/2024. The name \\'Poultsides\\' does not appear anywhere in the text, and there is no mention of a 1 week APP follow up.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s hospital stay, diagnosis, treatment, and follow up plans. To determine if the specific fact about follow up appointments is mentioned, we need to look for any reference to follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Dr. Poultsides, MD in 2 weeks. Upon reviewing the \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section and the \\'Problem Based Summary\\', there are detailed follow up plans for various conditions, but none explicitly mention follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider in 1 week or Dr. Poultsides, MD in 2 weeks. The closest relevant information is found under the different problem sections, which list various follow up recommendations, but the specific providers and timelines mentioned in the fact are not directly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary\\'s \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section and problem specific discharge plans list multiple follow up appointments (e.g., Interventional Radiology, Surgical Oncology, SLP, Dr. Butler, Radiation Oncology, primary care/endocrinologist, and Nutrition Cancer Center). However, there is no mention of follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider (NP/PA) in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. The name \\'Poultsides, George, MD\\' does not appear in the text, and no follow up timeframe of 1 or 2 weeks is specified for any APP. While follow up with various specialists is documented, the specific providers and timelines in the fact are absent.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 23, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find any explicit mention of cardiology coordinating follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR or a new clinical trial drug for April 2023. While there are mentions of cardiology follow up (specifically with Dr. Jolin pending and Dr. Mentzer on 07/05/2023) and discussions about the patient\\'s worsening mitral stenosis, the specific detail about transcatheter MVR and a clinical trial drug is not present. The summary does indicate that management plans for the worsening mitral stenosis are pending TTE results, but does not specify the potential treatment options being considered. The only cardiology related follow up information is found in the \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section and in Problem #3, neither of which mentions the specific fact we\\'re looking for.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, the \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists a Cardiology follow up appointment with Dr. Mentzer on 07/05/2023, and under \\'Problem #3: Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) / Worsening Mitral Stenosis,\\' it is mentioned that a repeat TTE was planned on 02/22/2023 to assess mitral valve gradient when euvolemic, with results pending at discharge. However, there is no explicit mention of Cardiology coordinating follow up with the Heart Failure team or discussing a transcatheter MVR or a new clinical trial drug in April 2023.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions cardiology follow up with Dr. Jolin (pending) and Dr. Mentzer on 07/05/2023 under Problem #3 (HFpEF/Mitral Stenosis), and a repeat TTE planned for 02/22/2023 to assess mitral stenosis. However, there is no explicit mention of coordination with the \\'Heart Failure team\\', \\'transcatheter MVR\\', or a \\'new clinical trial drug\\' in April 2023. The closest references are to standard cardiology follow up and diuretic management, but the specific elements of the fact (Heart Failure team involvement, transcatheter intervention, or clinical trial drug in 4/2023) are not stated in any section of the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 24, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the hospital course summary for mention of discharge with full liquid diet and oral pain medications: 1. Regarding diet: While the summary mentions plans to \\'advance diet to full liquids\\' on 08/19/2023, and discusses diet advancement plans in multiple sections, this is during the hospital stay, not at discharge. The summary actually indicates ongoing SBO issues (CT on 08/30/2023) and continued hospitalization (\\'He remained hospitalized for continued SBO management\\'). 2. Regarding pain medications: While pain management is mentioned (\\'IV Acetaminophen ATC\\'), there\\'s no explicit mention of discharge on oral pain medications. 3. The discharge plans mentioned are tentative and from 08/19/2023, prior to the 08/30 CT showing ongoing SBO. The actual discharge status and final medication/diet orders are not explicitly stated in this summary. Therefore, while diet advancement and pain management are discussed, the specific fact about being discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s management plan as of 08/19/2023. Under \\'Problem #5: Severe Malnutrition, Hypophosphatemia, and High Risk of Refeeding Syndrome,\\' the discharge plan includes advancing the diet to full liquids on 08/19, then to regular, high protein/calorie, small frequent meals. Additionally, under \\'Problem #1: Recurrent Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO),\\' the discharge plan mentions pain management, which includes IV Acetaminophen ATC, and later oral supplements. Although the document does not explicitly state \\'discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications,\\' it outlines a plan for diet advancement to full liquids and mentions oral nutritional supplements. However, the actual discharge status and whether the patient was discharged on these specific plans is not directly stated because the summary indicates ongoing issues and does not confirm discharge. The closest relevant information is the plan as of 08/19/2023, which includes advancing to full liquids and managing pain, initially with IV Acetaminophen. The summary does not explicitly confirm the patient was discharged on oral pain medications, as it primarily discusses IV Acetaminophen.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions plans to advance the diet to full liquids (under Problem #1 and #5 discharge plans) and includes oral nutritional supplements. However, the summary states the patient \\'remained hospitalized for continued SBO management and nutritional support\\' as of the latest update (09/01/2023). While oral pain medications are not explicitly mentioned in the discharge plan (IV acetaminophen is noted), the key issue is that discharge itself did not occur according to the provided documentation. The fact specifically refers to being \\'discharged on\\' these regimens, which never happened per the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 25, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I searched the hospital course summary for the specific fact about the upper GI series findings and GI consultations. Here\\'s my analysis: 1. The summary does mention an Upper GI Single Contrast Study on 01/13/2024 that showed \\'no gastric outlet obstruction\\' this matches part of the fact. 2. The summary mentions duodenal/jejunal findings but doesn\\'t specifically state \\'no significant obstruction along the duodenum.\\' 3. While IV famotidine is mentioned (\\'IV famotidine initiated for duodenitis\\'), the switch to PPI BID is not explicitly stated, though pantoprazole is listed as a discharge medication. 4. The summary does mention consultation with Advanced GI and their decision to defer ERCP, but does not mention general GI consultation or specific recommendations for 8 weeks of empiric PPI therapy and outpatient ERCP evaluation. 5. While some elements are present (no gastric outlet obstruction, Advanced GI consultation, ERCP deferral), several key components of the fact are missing or different from what\\'s stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Upper GI Findings : The summary explicitly states \\'No gastric outlet obstruction\\' from the Upper GI study but does not mention \\'significant obstruction along the duodenum.\\' Instead, it reports mucosal thickening/nodularity in the duodenum, which is a distinct finding. The absence of explicit mention of duodenal obstruction means this part of the fact is missing. 2. Famotidine to PPI Transition : IV famotidine initiation is documented, and pantoprazole (a PPI) is prescribed at discharge. However, the summary specifies \\'pantoprazole 40 mg daily\\' (QD), not BID (twice daily), and does not mention a switch from famotidine to PPI during admission. 3. GI Consultations and ERCP/PPI Plan : The summary notes ERCP deferral and outpatient ERCP evaluation, and Advanced GI consultation. However, it does not mention involvement of \\'general GI,\\' deferral of EGD, or an 8 week PPI course. The PPI duration and BID dosing are absent. Conclusion: While parts of the fact are present (e.g., no gastric outlet obstruction, ERCP deferral), critical components (duodenal obstruction assessment, PPI BID, 8 week duration, EGD deferral, and general GI involvement) are missing. A busy physician would not consider the fact fully stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'moderate narrowing of proximal superior mesenteric artery\\' (SMA stenosis) on CT angiography under Problem #1. However, it specifically states \\'no acute mesenteric ischemia\\' and attributes the gastrointestinal symptoms to gastritis/dyspepsia/gastroparesis. While SMA stenosis is documented, there is no explicit linkage made between this finding and chronic mesenteric ischemia as a potential cause of emesis. The clinical team focused on other etiologies (gastritis, etc.) and did not mention chronic mesenteric ischemia in their assessment or differential for the vomiting.\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient was admitted for neutropenic fever and had Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) bacteremia. However, the fact specifies \\'coagulase negative strep bacteremia,\\' which refers to a different genus (Streptococcus vs. Staphylococcus). CoNS is a common cause of line associated bacteremia, but the summary does not mention Streptococcus species. The PICC line removal (03/05) and antibiotic treatment (Vancomycin, Cefepime, Piperacillin Tazobactam, Linezolid) are clearly documented. While the clinical scenario aligns with the fact’s structure, the specific organism (Strep vs. Staph) discrepancy means the fact as written is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**34. Patient 27, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions a Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) performed on 03/06/23, stating it was \\'negative for vegetations\\' and \\'no vegetation\\' in two sections. However, the summary does not explicitly mention the absence of a cardiac mass. While the TTE\\'s normal LV function is noted, the absence of a mass is not directly addressed. Since the fact requires both \\'no mass\\' and \\'no vegetations,\\' and only the latter is explicitly documented, the specific fact as stated is not fully mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**35. Patient 27, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions imaging (CT maxillofacial) showing \\'mildly enlarged/heterogeneous palatine tonsils, suggestive of possible tonsillitis\\' and documents antibiotic therapy (Piperacillin Tazobactam, later Linezolid) for this indication. However, no specific localizing symptoms (e.g., sore throat, dysphagia) directly attributable to tonsillitis are described. While systemic symptoms (fever, headache) and maxillary/gum pain are noted, these were initially attributed to sinusitis or dental issues. The diagnosis of tonsillitis was imaging driven rather than symptom driven. Since the fact requires both imaging and localizing symptoms, and the latter are not explicitly documented, the fact is not fully addressed.\\n\\n\\n\\n**36. Patient 28, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, the specific fact about PTBD exchange on 4/21/23 is not mentioned. While the summary does document biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia and mentions PTBD exchanges, the dates mentioned are different. Specifically, the summary notes a PTBD exchange on 04/08/2023 (where the left PTBD was upsized from 14 Fr to 16 Fr), and lists previous exchanges including one on 03/25/2023. The patient was actually discharged to hospice on 04/12/2023, which makes a 4/21/23 PTBD exchange impossible within this admission. The summary thoroughly documents the patient\\'s biliary issues and PTBD management, but the specific exchange on 4/21/23 is not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was thoroughly analyzed to determine if it explicitly mentions the fact \\'Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23.\\' The summary indicates that the patient was admitted for management of biliary obstruction related to advanced recurrent cholangiocarcinoma and involved management of hyperbilirubinemia with a biliary drain exchange. Specifically, under Problem #2: Biliary Obstruction and Cholangitis, it is noted that an Interventional Radiology Biliary Drain Exchange was performed on 04/08/2023, where the left PTBD was upsized from 14 Fr to 16 Fr internal/external. Although the date mentioned in the fact (4/21/23) does not match the date in the summary (04/08/2023), the key elements of the fact—admission for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction, hyperbilirubinemia, and PTBD exchange—are all present in the summary. The discrepancy in dates (04/08/2023 vs 4/21/23) is significant and indicates the fact is not explicitly mentioned as it specifies a different date for the PTBD exchange.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions recurrent malignant biliary obstruction (due to cholangiocarcinoma) and hyperbilirubinemia. However, the PTBD exchange is documented as occurring on 04/08/2023, not 04/21/2023. Since the discharge occurred on 04/12/2023, a PTBD exchange on 04/21/2023 would fall outside the admission period described. The date discrepancy is critical here, as the fact specifies 04/21/2023, which is not mentioned in the summary. All other components of the fact are present, but the incorrect date renders the full fact unmentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**37. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I cannot find an explicit statement that the bilirubin failed to improve despite PTBD exchange. In fact, the summary indicates the opposite under Problem #2, it states \\'Total bilirubin 17.6 mg/dL on 04/06/2023, improved to 10.8 mg/dL on 04/11/2023,\\' showing improvement after the PTBD exchange performed on 04/08/2023. While the patient did transition to hospice care, this appears to be due to overall prognosis and limited benefit from further aggressive interventions rather than specifically due to failed biliary drainage. The summary states \\'Given his overall prognosis and limited benefit from further aggressive interventions, the focus of care transitioned to palliation.\\' Therefore, while the transition to hospice is mentioned, the specific fact about bilirubin not improving despite PTBD exchange is not present and appears to be contradicted by the documented lab values.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s management for biliary obstruction related to advanced recurrent cholangiocarcinoma, including a Percutaneous Transhepatic Biliary Drain (PTBD) exchange on 04/08/2023. The summary under Problem #2: Biliary Obstruction and Cholangitis indicates that the total bilirubin improved from 17.6 mg/dL on 04/06/2023 to 10.8 mg/dL on 04/11/2023, suggesting that bilirubin levels did improve after the PTBD exchange. The summary also confirms that the patient was transitioned to home hospice care on 04/12/2023, as per the family\\'s wishes and in line with the patient\\'s overall prognosis and palliative care goals. However, it does not explicitly state that \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange.\\' Instead, it shows an improvement in bilirubin levels post exchange. Thus, the specific fact \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice\\' is not explicitly mentioned because the first part regarding bilirubin not improving is contradicted by the data provided in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that a PTBD exchange was performed on 04/08/2023 and that hyperbilirubinemia improved (total bilirubin decreased from 17.6 mg/dL to 10.8 mg/dL post exchange). However, there is no statement indicating that bilirubin \\'did not improve\\' after the exchange. The transition to home hospice is clearly documented, but the reason provided for this transition is the patient\\'s \\'overall prognosis and limited benefit from further aggressive interventions,\\' not a lack of bilirubin improvement. While both components of the fact (PTBD exchange and hospice transition) are present, the causal relationship between unimproved bilirubin and hospice choice is not stated. The summary instead attributes the decision to the broader clinical context.\\n\\n\\n\\n**38. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the components of the fact systematically: 1. Sepsis requiring antibiotics and fluid resuscitation: Problem #2 shows treatment with Piperacillin Tazobactam and IV fluids, but sepsis is not explicitly mentioned While there was leukocytosis and hypotension, the term \\'sepsis\\' is never used 2. Delirium requiring pharmacotherapy: Problem #7 explicitly mentions \\'Acute delirium\\' and its treatment with mirtazapine and melatonin 3. Urinary retention requiring catheter: Problem #3 mentions a Foley catheter and tamsulosin use, but doesn\\'t explicitly state \\'urinary retention\\' The context suggests oliguria (low urine output) rather than retention While some elements are present (delirium with pharmacotherapy), the specific combination of sepsis with antibiotics/fluids and urinary retention with catheter is not explicitly stated as described in the fact. The hospital course had similar elements but different contexts or descriptions.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis: The summary mentions treatment with IV Piperacillin Tazobactam (antibiotics) and IV fluids, which are components of sepsis management. However, the term \\'sepsis\\' is never explicitly stated; the diagnosis is cholangitis. While antibiotics and fluids are present, sepsis itself is not clearly identified. 2. Delirium: Explicitly mentioned in Problem #7, with pharmacotherapy (mirtazapine and melatonin) used. This component is satisfied. 3. Urinary retention: A Foley catheter is documented, but the indication is oliguria/acute kidney injury (low urine output), not urinary retention (inability to void). The summary does not mention urinary retention. Since two of the three components (sepsis and urinary retention) lack explicit or equivalent mention, the full fact is not stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**39. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that the specified fact about deferring cancer management is partially but not fully mentioned in the way described. While the summary mentions the patient\\'s delirium (Problem #6) and indicates oncology follow up is planned (\\'Outpatient Oncology for treatment planning (radiation +/ chemotherapy). Family discussing preferences.\\'), it does not explicitly state that management was deferred due to the son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium. The summary indicates family involvement in decision making (\\'Family discussing preferences\\') and documents the patient\\'s delirium, but does not explicitly connect these factors as the reason for deferring cancer management to outpatient care. The causative relationship between the son\\'s wishes, delirium, and the decision to defer treatment is not explicitly stated in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states that treatment for metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was deferred to outpatient oncology (\\'Urgent outpatient consultation for initiation of treatment\\' in Outstanding Issues/Follow Up and \\'Outpatient Oncology for treatment planning\\' in Problem #1). However, the summary does not explicitly mention that this deferral was due to the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes or the patient\\'s delirium. While the patient\\'s delirium is documented in Problem #6 and family discussions are noted (\\'Family discussing preferences\\'), the text does not directly link these factors to the decision to defer treatment. The deferral is presented as a care transition rather than a decision driven by family input or delirium.\\n\\n\\n\\n### B.

All Inconsistent Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 1, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypoxia 2/2 recurrent R pleura effusion\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states hypoxia is due to recurrent right pleural effusion. 2. Summary notes chest tube drainage (01/17 02/02) decreased effusion, but hypoxia persisted (SpO2 mid 80s) even after effusion resolution. 3. Persistent hypoxia post drainage contradicts effusion as sole cause, suggesting alternative etiologies (e.g., bibasilar opacities, chronic respiratory insufficiency).\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 3, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** LLQ abdominal pain 2/2 cancer\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states LLQ abdominal pain is due to cancer (2/2 cancer). 2. The Hospital Summary describes a \\'new episode of LLQ abdominal pain associated with diarrhea\\' (Problem #2) and notes CT Abdomen/Pelvis (09/16/2023) found \\'no acute intra abdominal source\\' for the pain flare. 3. While the patient has progressive cancer, the summary explicitly attributes the new LLQ pain to diarrhea rather than directly linking it to cancer progression, creating a contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions T1DM management was \\'transitioned to subcutaneous regimen (Levemir 16 units BID)\\' 2. This directly contradicts the fact stating \\'insulin changed to lantus 15 units twice a day\\' 3. Different insulin types (Levemir vs. Lantus) and different doses (16 units vs. 15 units) are specified 4. Both statements cannot be true simultaneously as they describe different insulin regimens for the same time period\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions that the patient\\'s Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus management continued successfully on a subcutaneous insulin regimen, specifically stating \\'Levemir 16 units BID\\' on 01/24/2023. The Important Fact states that insulin was changed to Lantus 15 units twice a day. The summary and the fact are inconsistent because they specify different insulin types (Levemir vs. Lantus) and dosages (16 units vs. 15 units).\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states insulin changed to Lantus 15 units BID. 2. Hospital Summary (Problem #3) documents subcutaneous insulin regimen as Levemir 16 units BID, not Lantus. 3. Levemir and Lantus are distinct basal insulins; both cannot be true simultaneously. 4. No other insulin changes mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 7, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left renal cell carcinoma status-post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post-op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\' was administered. 2. The Hospital Course Summary specifies \\'neoadjuvant therapy (cabozantinib)\\' in the Relevant Medical History. 3. Cabozantinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (targeted therapy), not chemotherapy. 4. This creates a direct contradiction in treatment modality (chemotherapy vs. targeted therapy).\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 7, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Continued on apixaban post-op\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary indicates the patient was discharged on Lovenox (enoxaparin), not apixaban. 2. Specifically, Problem #6 states \\'Discharged on Lovenox (enoxaparin)\\' and mentions future \\'determination of ongoing anticoagulation plan, duration of Lovenox therapy, and plan for transition to/reassessment of home apixaban.\\' 3. The Outstanding Issues section also confirms this, mentioning \\'determination of definitive long term anticoagulation plan (duration of Lovenox therapy and plan for transition to/reassessment for apixaban).\\' 4. Therefore, the statement that the patient \\'continued on apixaban post op\\' directly contradicts the hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that the patient was discharged on Lovenox, and under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\', it mentions \\'determination of definitive long term anticoagulation plan (duration of Lovenox therapy and plan for transition to/reassessment for apixaban)\\'. This indicates that the patient was not continued on apixaban post op but was instead on Lovenox with plans to reassess apixaban later. Thus, the summary contradicts the fact that the patient was continued on apixaban post op.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the patient \\'continued on apixaban post op.\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary (Problem #6) specifies the patient was transitioned to Lovenox (enoxaparin) for discharge, with plans to determine \\'transition to/reassessment for apixaban\\' as an outstanding issue. 3. Apixaban was held perioperatively (Relevant Medical History) and not resumed at discharge, directly conflicting with the assertion of continuation post op.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 8, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Down\\'s syndrome, neurogenic bladder, admitted for pneumonia, treated with CAP regimen and vancomycin due to positive sputum culture for MRSA\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states MRSA was found in sputum culture. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s sputum culture (06/10) reports \\'1+ Staphylococcus aureus\\' but does not specify MRSA. 3. MRSA nares PCR was positive (06/12), but this indicates nasal colonization, not sputum confirmed MRSA pneumonia. 4. Vancomycin use aligns with MRSA risk (nares colonization), but the summary does not confirm MRSA in sputum, contradicting the Fact\\'s claim.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The Important Fact mentions a potential aspiration event prior to discharge and 1/4 bottles positive for GPC with incomplete speciation. 2. The Hospital Course Summary does not mention any aspiration event near discharge. 3. The blood culture results mentioned in the summary state \\'Blood cultures (06/09/2023): No growth to date\\' with no mention of positive bottles. 4. These are direct contradictions the summary cannot be accurate if there were positive blood cultures and a pre discharge aspiration event that weren\\'t documented.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact mentions a potential aspiration event prior to discharge. The summary\\'s only reference to aspiration is the admission chest X ray (06/09/2023) showing \\'pneumonia/aspiration,\\' with no documentation of new aspiration events near discharge (06/18/2023). 2. The Important Fact states \\'1/4 bottles positive for GPC\\' (likely blood cultures). The summary explicitly states blood cultures (06/09/2023) had \\'no growth to date,\\' directly conflicting with the GPC positive result. 3. The summary does not mention pending speciation for any cultures at discharge, while the Important Fact specifies speciation was incomplete by discharge. The urine culture (06/09/2023) results were pending follow up, but this was not related to blood cultures or GPC.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states the patient was treated with IV antibiotics (Vancomycin, Duluth, then Zosyn) and is awaiting final urine culture sensitivities to guide appropriate oral antibiotic therapy. 2. The fact states the patient is finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge. 3. This is inconsistent because: The summary does not mention Cipro being prescribed The summary explicitly states they are still waiting for culture sensitivities to determine appropriate oral antibiotics The antibiotic course is not yet determined at the time this summary was written\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient was finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge for sepsis from a urinary source with potential pyelonephritis. The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient was admitted for sepsis secondary to a complicated urinary tract infection with developing pyelonephritis and was treated with intravenous antibiotics (initially Vancomycin and Duluth, then Zosyn [piperacillin tazobactam]). The summary also mentions that the discharge plan included transitioning to an appropriate course of oral antibiotics guided by pending urine culture sensitivities for Klebsiella pneumoniae . There is no mention of cipro in the Hospital Course Summary as part of the treatment or discharge plan. The absence of cipro in the summary and the mention of awaiting urine culture sensitivities to guide oral antibiotic therapy indicates a potential contradiction with the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states patient was \\'finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge,\\' but the Hospital Course Summary specifies Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam) as the antibiotic used during hospitalization and plans to transition to oral antibiotics guided by pending culture sensitivities (no mention of ciprofloxacin). 2. Finasteride was initiated for prostatomegaly (explicitly stated in the summary) rather than UTI prevention as claimed in the Important Fact. These discrepancies directly conflict.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 12, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient sent to the hospital from home for symptoms of tachycardia, hypotension, found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula\\n\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states the patient was found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s Problem #2 notes a pre admission CT (03/11) suggested a possible fistula, but the in house CT (03/17) showed \\'no visualized fistula\\'. 3. The summary explicitly states the fistula was not confirmed during hospitalization, contradicting the fact\\'s assertion it was \\'found\\'.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient had an \\'unremarkable post operative course and discharge home\\' after a bilateral mastectomy. The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient underwent bilateral complete mastectomies and right axillary lymph node dissection. The postoperative course was generally recovering well, but several issues arose, including elevated lidocaine levels leading to symptoms like blurry vision and tachycardia, elevated blood pressures, hyperglycemia, a panic attack, and coccyx skin blistering. These complications indicate that the postoperative course was not entirely \\'unremarkable\\' as stated in the Important Fact. However, by 06/25/2023, the patient was described as \\'doing well postoperatively,\\' suggesting a general trend towards recovery despite the mentioned complications.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'unremarkable post operative course\\', but the summary documents multiple complications: lidocaine toxicity (symptoms, elevated level 58.0 ug/mL), panic attack requiring Ativan, persistent hypertension, hyperglycemia requiring insulin adjustment, and coccyx blistering. 2. These complications required specific interventions (drip discontinuation, medication changes, consults), contradicting \\'unremarkable\\' course. 3. While discharge occurred, the postoperative period had significant deviations from normal recovery.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows worsening of DM2 during the hospital stay: Glucose levels remained elevated (245 mg/dL, 206 mg/dL on 06/24/2023; 231 mg/dL on 06/25/2023) Insulin sliding scale had to be increased to \\'moderate\\' Listed as an outstanding issue requiring ongoing management 2. This directly contradicts the Important Fact which states DM2 was not worsened perioperatively 3. The deterioration in glycemic control is clearly documented and required intervention, indicating perioperative worsening of her diabetes\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient\\'s chronic medical conditions, including DM2, were not worsened perioperatively. The Hospital Course Summary under Problem #5: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus indicates that the patient\\'s glucose levels remained elevated during the hospital stay, with values such as 245 mg/dL, 206 mg/dL on 06/24/2023, and 231 mg/dL on 06/25/2023. It is also noted that the insulin sliding scale was increased to \\'moderate\\' during the hospital stay, indicating a need for adjustment in managing the patient\\'s hyperglycemia. The presence of elevated glucose levels and the need to adjust the insulin sliding scale suggest that the patient\\'s DM2 was not perfectly controlled during the perioperative period, implying some level of worsening or strain on the condition.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states that chronic conditions (including DM2) were not worsened perioperatively. 2. The Hospital Summary under Problem #5 (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus documents elevated glucose levels (245, 206, 231 mg/dL) requiring an increased insulin sliding scale to \\'moderate.\\' 3. Persistent hyperglycemia and escalated insulin dosing indicate worsening glycemic control perioperatively. 4. This directly contradicts the assertion that DM2 was not worsened.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary describes a patient admitted with severe nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and subsequent acute kidney injury (AKI). The principal symptoms of nausea and vomiting resolved by hospital day 2, and the patient was tolerating a regular diet. The CT Abdomen/Pelvis suggested possible esophagitis, but the primary reason for admission (nausea and vomiting) was not attributed to viral gastroenteritis. The summary does not mention viral gastroenteritis as a diagnosis or a consideration at any point during the hospital course.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The principal diagnosis at discharge is stated as viral gastroenteritis. 2. The hospital course attributes nausea/vomiting to possible esophagitis (CT finding) and AKI to suspected ATN from dehydration, with no mention of viral etiology. 3. Infection was considered less likely (antibiotics discontinued 03/23), but no viral testing or gastroenteritis diagnosis is documented. 4. The discharge workup focuses on esophagitis evaluation and transplant related AKI, not viral illness. These elements conflict with viral gastroenteritis as the principal diagnosis.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups.\\' 2. The Hospital Summary documents multiple negative infectious workups (blood cultures, urine analysis, CXR, CT abdomen/pelvis, respiratory viral panel, CSF, MRSA screen) but explicitly states \\'Awaiting CT Chest results... for ongoing fever workup.\\' 3. A pending CT Chest (part of pulmonary infection evaluation) means the infectious workup is incomplete, contradicting the assertion that workups are fully negative. 4. The summary also states \\'Definitive etiology of recurrent fever remains unclear,\\' aligning with the fact\\'s \\'suspected\\' pulmonary infection but conflicting with the incomplete workup status.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 18, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The Important Fact states that \\'Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary shows: AKI did resolve (Cr improved from 0.80 mg/dL to 0.52 mg/dL) However, hypokalemia persisted (K remained low at 3.3 mmol/L) despite supplementation 3. This directly contradicts the Important Fact\\'s claim that both conditions resolved 4. The summary explicitly states \\'mild hypokalemia persisted\\' multiple times\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that \\'His admission Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) resolved, though mild hypokalemia persisted.\\' This indicates that the AKI resolved during admission, which is consistent with the Important Fact. However, it also mentions that \\'mild hypokalemia persisted,\\' which contradicts the Important Fact that \\'Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission.\\' The fact states that both AKI and hypokalemia resolved, but the summary indicates that while AKI resolved, hypokalemia did not. Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission.\\' 2. Hospital Summary under Problem #3 explicitly states \\'AKI resolved (Cr 0.52 mg/dL on 08/06)\\' but notes \\'mild hypokalemia persisted (K 3.3 mmol/L on 08/06) despite supplementation.\\' 3. This directly contradicts the claim that hypokalemia resolved, as unresolved hypokalemia is documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 19, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis).\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions hydronephrosis and UTI, with urine culture positive for Enterococcus faecalis only. 2. The Important Fact states hydronephrosis is complicated by UTIs with ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella in addition to Enterococcus faecalis. 3. The summary shows no evidence of ESBL E. coli or Klebsiella infections only Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from the urine culture. 4. This represents a clear contradiction between the organisms mentioned in the Important Fact versus those documented in the hospital course.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states hydronephrosis is complicated by UTIs with ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s urine culture (04/01/2023) identifies Enterococcus faecalis but does not mention ESBL E. coli or Klebsiella. 3. CT findings note hydroureteronephrosis but no documentation of pathogens beyond Enterococcus faecalis. 4. Pending GC testing and sensitivities do not address ESBL E. coli/Klebsiella, creating a direct contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 20, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** HHT with new PE/DVT s/p IVC filter placement as well as changed to fondaparinux\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was on Fondaparinux until 05/16/2023, when anticoagulation was switched to Apixaban. This contradicts the Important Fact that states the patient was changed to Fondaparinux after IVC filter placement. The summary confirms the IVC filter placement on 05/10/2023 and that Fondaparinux was the anticoagulation therapy before switching to Apixaban on 05/16/2023.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states anticoagulation was \\'changed to fondaparinux\\'. 2. Hospital Summary documents Fondaparinux was started 05/09/2023 (pre admission) and switched to Apixaban on 05/16/2023. 3. This shows a change FROM Fondaparinux TO Apixaban, directly contradicting the fact\\'s claim of a change TO Fondaparinux.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact mentions \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\'. The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient had progressive thrombocytopenia and Prednisone was increased to 100mg daily on 05/15/2023 for presumed Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP). There is no mention of a Prednisone taper initiation in the Hospital Course Summary; instead, it mentions an increase in Prednisone dosage. The absence of a taper initiation in the summary contradicts the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'s/p prednisone taper initiation\\' implying a planned reduction in dose. 2. Hospital summary states Prednisone was increased to 100mg daily on 05/15/2023 for ITP, with no documented taper initiation. 3. Summary explicitly notes discharge plans for steroid tapering were not available in documentation. These points conflict with the fact\\'s assertion of a taper being started.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions a \\'new T6 anterior wedge compression deformity\\' discovered on CT scan on 03/14/2023. 2. The summary consistently refers to this fracture as being associated with the recent fall that prompted admission. 3. This directly contradicts the Important Fact which states the T6 wedge compression fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall\\'. 4. The summary\\'s characterization of the fracture as \\'new\\' and its association with the recent fall cannot both be true if the fracture predated the fall as stated in the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the T6 wedge compression fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall\\'. The Hospital Course Summary under Problem #1: Recurrent Falls and T6 Wedge Compression Fracture states that \\'CT Chest Abdomen Pelvis (03/14/2023) confirmed new T6 anterior wedge compression deformity.\\' The term \\'new\\' indicates the fracture occurred recently, contradicting the Important Fact that it \\'likely happened before most recent fall\\'. Therefore, the Hospital Course Summary contradicts the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the T6 fracture \\'happened before most recent fall.\\' 2. The Hospital Summary (Problem #1) states the T6 fracture was \\'confirmed new\\' on 03/14/2023 and attributes it to \\'recurrent falls, culminating in a T6 compression fracture.\\' 3. \\'Culminating\\' and \\'new\\' directly link the fracture to the most recent fall, contradicting the fact that it occurred earlier.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 22, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary describes cholangitis with E. coli bacteremia related to biliary drains, but does not mention it being post procedural following a recent stent exchange. 2. The surgical history shows the most recent biliary procedure was a drain exchange on 12/24 or 12/25/2022, not a stent exchange. 3. The most recent stent related procedure mentioned was an ERCP with stent placement on 11/14/2022, which is not recent relative to this admission on 12/27/2022. 4. While cholangitis is present, its etiology is attributed to existing biliary drains rather than a post procedural complication from stent exchange.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states to \\'continue and re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion.\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary explicitly documents the use of intravenous piperacillin tazobactam (not Augmentin) for cholangitis, with a plan for oral step down but no mention of Augmentin. 3. Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate) and piperacillin tazobactam are distinct antibiotics; using one contradicts plans involving the other unless explicitly transitioned, which is not documented here.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 22, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** patient should follow up with Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/ Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Poultsides, George, MD in in 2 weeks\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact specifies follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider (APP) in 1 week and Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. 2. The Hospital Course Summary\\'s \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' and discharge plans list follow ups with Interventional Radiology, Surgical Oncology, Dr. Butler (oncologist), Radiation Oncology (01/02/2024), SLP/Nutrition/Gastroenterology/ENT/dietitians, and primary care/endocrinology, but no mention of APP or Dr. Poultsides. 3. Since the summary omits these two specific providers entirely, it directly contradicts the fact\\'s follow up instructions.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 23, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states Cardiology will coordinate follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss a transcatheter MVR and a new clinical trial drug in 4/2023. 2. The Hospital Course Summary\\'s Cardiology follow up (under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\') lists appointments with Dr. Jolin (pending) and Dr. Mentzer on 07/05/2023, with no mention of the Heart Failure team or a clinical trial drug. 3. The repeat TTE (02/22/2023) for mitral stenosis is noted, but results are pending, and no transcatheter MVR or trial drug is discussed. 4. The absence of these specific actions in the summary directly contradicts the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 24, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows the patient had ongoing SBO per CT scan on 08/30/2023 and remained hospitalized for continued management 2. Labs on 09/01/2023 showed persistent hypophosphatemia 3. The summary indicates continued hospitalization for SBO management and nutritional support, not discharge 4. This directly contradicts the fact stating the patient was \\'discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\'\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the patient was \\'discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications.\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary explicitly states he \\'remained hospitalized for continued SBO management and nutritional support\\' as of 08/30/2023 and 09/01/2023 labs, indicating no discharge occurred. 3. While the discharge plan (as of 08/19/2023) included advancing to full liquids and oral supplements, the summary clarifies this plan was not executed due to ongoing SBO and persistent hypophosphatemia, requiring continued hospitalization. 4. The contradiction arises because the fact claims discharge occurred with these interventions, but the summary confirms the patient was not discharged.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 25, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states the patient was switched to PPI BID. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s discharge plan lists pantoprazole 40 mg daily (once daily), conflicting with BID dosing. 3. Both cannot be true simultaneously, indicating contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 25, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that \\'AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved\\'. The Hospital Course Summary under Problem #5: Acute Kidney Injury (Resolved) mentions that \\'Creatinine rose from baseline 0.87 mg/dL (01/07/2024) to peak 1.09 mg/dL (01/13/2024)\\', indicating AKI developed during the admission, not on admission. It further states that \\'AKI resolved with hydration and holding diuretics\\', which aligns with the treatment mentioned in the Important Fact. The discrepancy lies in the timing of AKI (\\'on admission\\' vs. \\'developed during admission\\').\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient was admitted for neutropenic fever and found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia, treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics. The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient was admitted for neutropenic fever following consolidation chemotherapy for Acute Myeloid Leukemia and was found to have Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) bacteremia. The summary confirms the removal of the LUE PICC line on 03/05 due to bacteremia and treatment with various antibiotics including Vancomycin and Linezolid. The key difference lies in the organism identified: the Important Fact mentions \\'coagulase negative strep,\\' while the summary specifies \\'Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (MecA positive, Vancomycin MIC = 2 µg/mL)\\'. Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus is not the same as coagulase negative streptococcus; they belong to different genera and have different implications for treatment. The summary does not mention PICC line replacement, only removal, which partially contradicts the \\'PICC removal/replacement\\' part of the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the patient had \\'coagulase negative strep bacteremia,\\' but the Hospital Course Summary explicitly identifies the pathogen as \\'Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (MecA positive)\\' in blood cultures. 2. Coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) and coagulase negative Streptococcus are distinct bacterial species; they cannot both be the causative organism in this context. 3. This direct microbiological contradiction (Staph vs. Strep) makes the summary inconsistent with the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 28, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The Important Fact states PTBD exchange occurred on 4/21/23 2. However, the hospital course summary indicates: Patient was discharged to hospice on 4/12/23 The last PTBD exchange was on 4/08/23 (upsized from 14 Fr to 16 Fr) No mention of any planned PTBD exchange on 4/21/23 3. Since the patient was already discharged on 4/12/23, it would be impossible for them to have had a PTBD exchange on 4/21/23 during this admission\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that Mr. Green was admitted for management of biliary obstruction related to his advanced recurrent cholangiocarcinoma and underwent a biliary drain exchange. Specifically, it is mentioned that \\'Interventional Radiology Biliary Drain Exchange on 04/08/2023 (left PTBD upsized from 14 Fr to 16 Fr internal/external)\\' was performed. The Important Fact states that the patient was admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23. However, the summary shows that the PTBD exchange occurred on 04/08/2023, not 4/21/23. Despite this discrepancy in dates, the summary is consistent with the fact that the patient was admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction and required a PTBD exchange. The difference in dates (04/08/2023 vs 4/21/23) indicates a contradiction.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states PTBD exchange occurred on 4/21/23. 2. The Hospital Course Summary documents PTBD exchange on 04/08/2023 (Problem #2: \\'Interventional Radiology Biliary Drain Exchange on 04/08/2023\\'). 3. The discharge occurred on 04/12/2023, making a 4/21/23 procedure during this admission impossible. These dates are mutually exclusive.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states bilirubin improved from 17.6 mg/dL on 04/06/2023 to 10.8 mg/dL on 04/11/2023 after PTBD exchange on 04/08/2023. 2. This directly contradicts the Important Fact which states \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange\\'. 3. While both summaries agree on the transition to hospice, they disagree on the response to PTBD intervention. 4. The improvement in bilirubin levels is specifically documented in Problem #2 under \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\'.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient\\'s hyperbilirubinemia improved after a biliary drain exchange. Specifically, it states that \\'Total bilirubin 17.6 mg/dL on 04/06/2023, improved to 10.8 mg/dL on 04/11/2023.\\' This directly contradicts the Important Fact that \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange.\\' Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange. 2. The Hospital Course Summary (Problem #2) reports total bilirubin improved from 17.6 mg/dL (04/06) to 10.8 mg/dL (04/11) after PTBD exchange on 04/08. 3. This direct improvement contradicts the claim of no improvement post PTBD. 4. The transition to hospice is confirmed in both sources, but the bilirubin trajectory conflicts.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states sepsis required antibiotics, but the summary attributes antibiotic use to cholangitis (Problem #2: \\'Intravenous Piperacillin Tazobactam\\' for biliary obstruction/cholangitis). Sepsis is not explicitly mentioned. 2. Aggressive fluid resuscitation (Problem #3: \\'intravenous fluid resuscitation\\') and urinary retention requiring catheter (Problem #3: \\'Foley catheter maintained\\') are consistent. 3. Delirium pharmacotherapy (Problem #7: \\'mirtazapine and melatonin\\') matches the fact. The contradiction arises because sepsis diagnosis in the fact conflicts with the summary\\'s attribution of antibiotics to cholangitis without sepsis documentation.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary indicates active oncology planning and follow up: \\'Urgent outpatient consultation for initiation of treatment for metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma\\' listed under Outstanding Issues \\'Family discussing preferences\\' mentioned under Problem #1 No mention of deferring management due to son\\'s wishes or delirium 2. While delirium is noted (Problem #6), it\\'s described as \\'significantly improved\\' by discharge 3. The summary shows active cancer management planning with: Pre chemotherapy workup completed Oncology follow up appointments scheduled Cancer Center referrals placed\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that management of the patient\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was deferred to an outpatient oncologist per the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and the patient\\'s delirium. The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was discharged with plans for \\'urgent outpatient consultation for initiation of treatment for metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma\\' and \\'Outpatient Oncology for treatment planning (radiation +/ chemotherapy)\\' with \\'family discussing preferences\\'. The summary does not mention that the management was deferred due to the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes. However, it does mention the patient\\'s delirium and plans for outpatient oncology consultation, which is consistent with deferring management to outpatient care.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Presence of important facts\\n\\n**Score: 65/100** (95% CI: 55-74) (higher values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the important facts missing:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries frequently omit critical clinical details due to recurring patterns: (1) **Procedural specifics exclusion**, where granular surgical steps (e.g., Patient 2’s adhesiolysis, Patient 7’s neoadjuvant chemotherapy) are omitted despite documenting primary interventions. (2) **Implicit milestones**, such as Patient 2’s lack of explicit bowel function documentation (flatus/BM) despite diet advancement, or Patient 18’s unresolved hypokalemia being overshadowed by resolved AKI. (3) **Medication/treatment ambiguities**, exemplified by Patient 6’s insulin regimen (Levemir vs. Lantus dosage discrepancies) and Patient 20’s mischaracterized prednisone dose increase as a “taper.” (4) **Diagnostic vagueness**, where Patient 12’s unconfirmed gallbladder fistula and Patient 18’s fever of unknown origin lack explicit linkage to suspected etiologies. (5) **Incomplete follow-up documentation**, such as Patient 12’s TPN discharge lacking a 4-week follow-up timeframe and Patient 22’s omitted APP/Dr. Poultsides appointments. (6) **Temporal inaccuracies**, as seen in Patient 28’s incorrectly dated PTBD exchange (4/8 vs. 4/21) and Patient 21’s T6 fracture timing ambiguity. These patterns highlight reliance on implied clinical reasoning over explicit documentation, particularly for comorbidities (Patient 13’s unremarked DM2 stability), medication changes (Patient 6’s adrenal crisis unrelated to prednisone), and diagnostic correlations (Patient 26’s SMA stenosis not tied to symptoms).\\n\\n### B.

All Missing Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 0, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left-sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The hospital course summary contains several references to the left JP drain and its status at discharge time: 1. In the Brief Description, it\\'s noted that \\'One of two abdominal (JP) drains was removed on post operative day 7\\' 2. Under Outstanding Issues/Follow Up, there\\'s explicit mention of \\'Status and care/management of the remaining (Left) JP drain if discharged with it\\' 3. In Problem #1, it states \\'Left JP drain output 130 mL on 11/25/2023\\' and lists \\'Final status (removed or to be managed outpatient) of the left JP drain at the time of actual discharge\\' as an outstanding issue However, while the presence and monitoring of the left JP drain is well documented, the summary does not explicitly state that the left JP drain was left in place at discharge. The references indicate uncertainty about its final disposition, with consideration for removal noted on 11/25. Without explicit confirmation of its status at actual discharge, we cannot definitively say this fact is mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 2, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed. Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, the specific fact about adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall being taken down and removal of obstructing necrotic mass with small bowel resection is not explicitly mentioned in the text. While the summary does mention that a \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' was performed on 04/23/2023, and the CT findings note \\'a new mass like lesion along the small bowel\\' with \\'necrotic features,\\' the specific surgical details about taking down adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall are not described. The summary mentions the procedure was performed but does not provide the granular operative details being sought. The closest relevant information is found in Problem #1 where it mentions the surgical procedure and the CT finding of the necrotic mass, but the specific operative steps of dealing with adhesions are not detailed.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' in both the Brief Description and Problem #1 sections. The necrotic small bowel mass is described in imaging findings and as the reason for surgery. However, there is no mention of adhesions between the omentum and abdominal wall being taken down. While the resection implies removal of the necrotic mass, the specific act of addressing adhesions is not documented. The absence of any reference to adhesiolysis or omental adhesions meets the criteria for 0, as this component of the fact is entirely missing from the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 2, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient recovered from surgery well; had flatus and bowel movement \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of the patient having flatus or bowel movement post surgery. While the summary does indicate that the patient recovered well from surgery (\\'Post operative day 3 (as of 04/26/2023). Recovering well from surgery.\\') and was tolerating diet advancement (\\'Diet advanced from NPO to Clear Liquids, Post Surgical Step 1, then Post Surgical Step 2 (PS2) diet\\'), there is no specific documentation of return of bowel function through flatus or bowel movement. The summary mentions resolution of nausea/vomiting and improved appetite, but these are different from the specific markers of bowel function we\\'re looking for. In a post operative course, return of bowel function would typically be documented if it occurred, as it\\'s an important milestone for recovery, but it is not explicitly stated in this summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states that the patient was \\'recovering well from surgery\\' under Problem #1\\'s Current Clinical Status, which satisfies the first part of the fact. However, the summary does not explicitly mention flatus or bowel movement. While it notes that the patient\\'s advancement to a Post Surgical Step 2 diet was tolerated and that nausea/vomiting resolved, these details imply but do not directly confirm the return of bowel function. The absence of explicit terms like \\'flatus\\' or \\'bowel movement\\' (or equivalents like \\'passing gas\\' or \\'BM\\') means the second part of the fact is not stated. Since both components of the fact are required, the overall fact is not fully mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details a patient admitted with adrenal crisis, characterized by severe hypotension, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The patient has a history of Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2, which includes Primary Adrenal Insufficiency (PAI), Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, and Hypothyroidism. The summary indicates that the patient was treated for adrenal crisis with stress dose IV hydrocortisone and IV fluids, and later transitioned to a tapering oral steroid regimen. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' under \\'Problem #1: Adrenal Crisis / Primary Adrenal Insufficiency (PAI)\\' outlines the patient\\'s condition and treatment. While the summary does not explicitly state that the adrenal crisis was due to intolerance of PO prednisone, it does mention that the patient was transitioned from IV hydrocortisone to PO hydrocortisone (25 mg q12h) as part of the tapering plan. The summary implies that the adrenal crisis was managed with hydrocortisone, not prednisone. However, it is worth noting that the patient was on a tapering oral steroid regimen at discharge, which could imply an issue with steroid tolerance or management. Despite this, the specific fact about intolerance to PO prednisone causing the adrenal crisis is not directly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course explicitly states the patient had an adrenal crisis in the context of primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) secondary to autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 2 (APS 2). However, the summary does not mention prednisone use or intolerance. The patient was treated with IV hydrocortisone and transitioned to oral hydrocortisone, not prednisone. While malabsorption was investigated, there is no direct link to prednisone intolerance. The phrase \\'intolerance of PO prednisone\\' or equivalent terminology is absent.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The hospital course summary does mention Type 1 diabetes and insulin changes, but not specifically Lantus 15 units twice daily. According to Problem #4, the patient was transitioned to \\'Levemir 16 units BID\\' (not Lantus), along with insulin lispro for meals. While this is similar to the fact we\\'re looking for (long acting insulin given twice daily), it\\'s not exactly the same medication or dosage specified. Levemir and Lantus are both long acting insulins, but they are different medications. The summary explicitly states the patient was discharged on \\'Levemir 16 units BID\\' rather than \\'Lantus 15 units twice a day.\\'\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient was transitioned from an insulin infusion to a subcutaneous insulin regimen on 01/24. The specific subcutaneous insulin regimen is detailed under Problem #4: Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, where it is stated that the patient was started on Levemir 16 units BID. The fact to be verified is \\'Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\' Lantus is a brand name for insulin glargine, which is a type of long acting insulin similar to Levemir (insulin detemir). Both are used for basal insulin coverage. The summary indicates a change to Levemir, not Lantus, and the dose is 16 units BID, not 15 units. Therefore, the exact fact mentioned is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly discusses the management of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in Problem #4. Under \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed,\\' it states the patient was transitioned to a subcutaneous insulin regimen with \\'Levemir 16 units BID\\' and insulin lispro. The fact in question specifies \\'Lantus 15 units twice a day.\\' While both Levemir and Lantus are long acting insulins, they are distinct formulations (insulin detemir vs. insulin glargine). The summary explicitly names Levemir, not Lantus, and specifies 16 units instead of 15. Since the fact requires both the specific insulin (Lantus) and dose (15 units BID), and neither is mentioned verbatim or via clinical synonym (e.g., \\'insulin glargine\\'), the fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 7, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left renal cell carcinoma status-post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post-op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy. \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission and treatment. Under \\'Problem #1: Malignant Neoplasm of Left Kidney with IVC Thrombus\\', it is mentioned that the patient had a left radical nephrectomy with lymphadenectomy and inferior vena cava tumor thrombectomy on 05/11/2023. The summary also states that the patient had a diagnosis of an \\'11.3 cm enhancing left renal mass, tumor thrombus within left renal vein and IVC extending to inferior right atrium\\'. The diagnostic investigations and results section under Problem #1 mentions that the ABD US on 09/01/2022 showed a \\'12.7 cm left renal mass concerning for renal cell carcinoma\\'. The fact \\'Left renal cell carcinoma status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy\\' is partially mentioned throughout the summary. The patient had left renal cell carcinoma (implied by the presence of a left renal mass concerning for renal cell carcinoma), underwent left nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy. However, the summary does not explicitly mention \\'neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\'. It mentions that \\'Cabozantinib (home immunotherapy) held perioperatively\\', which implies the patient was on some form of therapy before surgery, but it does not directly state it was neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) The summary explicitly states \\'left radical nephrectomy with IVC tumor thrombectomy\\' under Problem #1\\'s therapeutic procedures, confirming the surgical components. 2) \\'Left renal cell carcinoma\\' is explicitly documented in imaging findings (ABD US and CT CAP). 3) The term \\'neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\' is not mentioned. Cabozantinib (a targeted therapy, not chemotherapy) is referenced as held perioperatively, but there is no documentation of preoperative chemotherapy administration. Since the fact specifically includes \\'neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\' and this component is absent, the full fact is not explicitly stated despite the other elements being present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 7, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second-line\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find any explicit mention of a hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo (ipilimumab/nivolumab) or a switch to cabozantinib as second line therapy. While cabozantinib is mentioned once in the summary (\\'Cabozantinib (home immunotherapy) held perioperatively\\'), there is no indication that this was a second line treatment or that it was initiated due to a hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo. The summary does not mention ipi/nivo at all, nor does it describe any previous immunotherapy reactions. The only medication sensitivity noted is a nickel allergy in the medical history section. Without explicit documentation of either the hypersensitivity reaction or the treatment switch, we cannot confirm this fact from the provided text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission and treatment. The task is to determine if a hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo and a switch to cabozantinib as second line treatment is explicitly mentioned. Upon reviewing the summary, it is noted that \\'ipi/nivo\\' (ipilimumab/nivolumab) is not mentioned anywhere in the provided text. However, \\'Cabozantinib (home immunotherapy) held perioperatively\\' is mentioned under Problem #1: Malignant Neoplasm of Left Kidney with IVC Thrombus. This indicates that cabozantinib was a part of the patient\\'s home regimen but does not directly state that it was switched from ipi/nivo or that there was a hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo. Since the fact involving \\'hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo\\' is not mentioned, and the context of cabozantinib being a second line treatment after ipi/nivo is also not provided, the specific fact is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) Searched for mentions of immunotherapy agents (ipi/nivo = ipilimumab/nivolumab) in all sections. None are found in the summary. 2) Reviewed medication changes: Cabozantinib is mentioned under \\'Problem #1\\' as being held perioperatively and planned for resumption, but no rationale for its use is provided. 3) Scanned for hypersensitivity reactions: The only allergy listed is \\'Nickel allergy\\' in the medical history. No documentation of drug reactions, immune related adverse events, or treatment changes due to toxicity. 4) The text explicitly states \\'Cabozantinib (home immunotherapy) held perioperatively\\' but does not indicate this was a second line therapy after failed/discontinued ipi/nivo. The absence of any reference to prior immunotherapy use or adverse reactions to such agents means the specific fact cannot be confirmed as explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 7, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Continued on apixaban post-op\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that the patient was NOT continued on apixaban (Eliquis) post op. Specifically, in Problem #7 (DVT Prophylaxis), the summary indicates that the patient\\'s home Eliquis 5mg BID was held perioperatively, and while there was a brief note about restarting it on 05/17, the final discharge plan explicitly states the patient was discharged on Lovenox (enoxaparin). This is further reinforced in the Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section, which mentions \\'Lovenox administration and clarification of long term anticoagulation plan.\\' The summary makes it clear that Lovenox, not apixaban, was the anticoagulant chosen for discharge.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states in Problem #7 (DVT Prophylaxis) that the patient\\'s home Eliquis (apixaban) was held perioperatively and only \\'restarted briefly on 05/17 per one note, but discharge plan is Lovenox.\\' The discharge plan specifies Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis with a need to clarify the long term anticoagulation plan. Since the final discharge medication is Lovenox and there is no mention of apixaban continuation beyond the brief restart, the fact \\'continued on apixaban post op\\' is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of: 1) an aspiration event prior to discharge, 2) blood cultures with 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, or 3) pending speciation at discharge. The summary does mention blood cultures, but specifically states \\'Blood Cultures (06/09 and 06/17): No growth to date (NGTD for 06/09 sample, pending for 06/17 sample at time of last medical PN).\\' While there is mention of a transient fever on 6/6 and a blood culture drawn on 6/17, there is no indication of positive growth or GPC in any of the bottles. The patient\\'s dysphagia and G tube dependence are noted, but no aspiration events are documented. The only positive cultures mentioned are for MRSA nares and sputum Staph aureus from earlier in the admission (5/30 5/31).\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, treatment, and discharge. To determine if the fact \\'Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\' is mentioned, we need to look for any reference to an aspiration event, blood culture results, or any mention of GPC (Gram Positive Cocci). The summary includes various sections detailing the patient\\'s hospital course, diagnostic investigations, and therapeutic procedures. Under Problem #1: Community Acquired Pneumonia, it lists the diagnostic investigations and results, including blood cultures. The blood culture drawn on 06/17 is noted as \\'pending at the time of last medical PN\\' but there\\'s no specific mention of the result being positive for GPC or the speciation status. We need to check all sections for any mention of aspiration or GPC. Upon reviewing the entire summary, there\\'s no explicit mention of a \\'potential aspiration event prior to discharge\\' or \\'1/4 bottles positive for GPC\\'. The summary does mention sputum culture results and blood cultures, but the specific detail about GPC is not present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** Step 1: Search for \\'aspiration\\' or related terms in the hospital course. No mention of aspiration events is found in admission context, problem lists, or follow up plans. The patient has dysphagia/G tube dependence (a risk factor), but no documented aspiration event prior to discharge. Step 2: Check for microbiology results matching \\'1/4 bottles positive for GPC\\'. The sputum culture (5/30) showed Staph aureus (a GPC), but this is a respiratory sample, not blood culture bottles. Blood cultures from 6/09 and 6/17 show no growth/pending, with no reference to \\'1/4 bottles\\' positivity. Step 3: Verify speciation status. While the 6/17 blood culture was pending at discharge, this is not explicitly linked to GPC organisms. The fact requires a specific GPC positive culture bottle with pending speciation, which is absent in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the key elements of the fact: 1. Sepsis from urinary source with pyelonephritis: Explicitly confirmed in summary: Patient diagnosed with \\'complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, leading to sepsis\\' CT showed \\'subtle wedge shaped hypodensity of bilateral kidneys, concerning for developing pyelonephritis\\' 2. 7 day course of cipro on discharge: This specific detail is NOT mentioned. While antibiotics are discussed (Vancomycin, Zosyn), and there\\'s mention of pending sensitivities for potential de escalation, there\\'s no mention of ciprofloxacin or a 7 day course. 3. Started on finasteride to prevent future UTIs: Explicitly confirmed: \\'Finasteride was initiated for presumed prostatomegaly as a contributing factor to UTI\\' While two of the three components are clearly present (sepsis with pyelonephritis and finasteride initiation), the specific detail about a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin is not mentioned. Since all elements must be present for the fact to be considered fully mentioned, this is a 0.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, and treatment. The patient was diagnosed with a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, leading to sepsis and septic encephalopathy, with imaging suggesting developing pyelonephritis. The patient was treated with IV fluids and antibiotics, and finasteride was initiated for presumed prostatomegaly as a contributing factor to UTI. The summary explicitly mentions sepsis from a urinary source with potential pyelonephritis and the initiation of finasteride to prevent future UTIs. However, it does not explicitly state that the patient was finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge; instead, it mentions continuing Zosyn pending sensitivities for potential de escalation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis: The summary explicitly states the patient was diagnosed with \\'complicated UTI...leading to sepsis\\' and \\'imaging suggested developing pyelonephritis.\\' This matches the first part of the fact. 2. 7 day course of cipro on discharge: The discharge plan specifies continuing Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam) pending sensitivities. There is no mention of ciprofloxacin being prescribed or completed at discharge. This component is absent. 3. Finasteride initiation for UTI prevention: The summary states finasteride was started for \\'prostatomegaly as a contributing factor to UTI,\\' which aligns with the intent to prevent future UTIs. This matches the second part of the fact. Conclusion: While sepsis/UTI/pyelonephritis and finasteride initiation are explicitly documented, the 7 day cipro course at discharge is not mentioned. Since the fact requires all components, and one is missing, the overall fact is not fully stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 12, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient sent to the hospital from home for symptoms of tachycardia, hypotension, found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula\\n\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, the specific fact about a new gallbladder enteric fistula is not explicitly mentioned as a confirmed finding. However, there are several related points worth noting: 1. The summary mentions a \\'concern for gallbladder enteric fistula\\' under Problem #2 2. A pre admission CT from 03/11/2024 showed \\'sinus tract between gallbladder and RUQ collection/mucinous deposit with pneumobilia\\' 3. The current admission\\'s CT (03/17/2024) showed \\'fluid collection around gallbladder but no visualized fistula\\' 4. While the patient was admitted with tachycardia and hypotension, the summary does not explicitly state that these symptoms were due to a new gallbladder enteric fistula Therefore, while there was concern for a possible gallbladder enteric fistula, the summary does not explicitly confirm that a new fistula was found during this admission. In fact, the CT specifically notes that no fistula was visualized.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient was admitted from home with hypotension and tachycardia (Problem #1: \\'Presented with BP 80s/50s, HR 130s at home\\'). 2. The summary mentions a \\'concern for gallbladder enteric fistula\\' based on a pre admission CT (03/11/2024) showing a sinus tract between the gallbladder and RUQ collection. However, the CT during this admission (03/17/2024) specifically states \\'no visualized fistula,\\' and the summary clarifies that the gallbladder enteric fistula was \\'not visualized on this admission\\'s CT.\\' While the concern for the fistula is documented, the text does not confirm a new fistula was found during this admission. The fact requires explicit mention of a \\'new\\' fistula, which is absent here.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 12, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was started on empiric antibiotics but was found to have a normal WBC with normal lactate and abx were discontinued, he was not discharged on antibiotics\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention that the patient was started on empiric antibiotics. It states that \\'He underwent an infectious workup, which did not reveal an acute infection necessitating empiric antibiotics.\\' This implies that empiric antibiotics were not started because there was no indication for them after the workup. The summary also does not directly state that antibiotics were discontinued or that the patient was not discharged on antibiotics. However, it does list the discharge medications and does not mention antibiotics, supporting the fact that the patient was not discharged on antibiotics. The WBC count is mentioned as being normal (8.4 x10^9/L on admission and 5.1 x10^9/L on 03/18/2024), but lactate levels are not mentioned. Despite the lack of explicit mention of lactate or the discontinuation of antibiotics, the overall context suggests that the patient was not on antibiotics at discharge.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states that an infectious workup \\'did not reveal an acute infection necessitating empiric antibiotics,\\' and there is no mention of antibiotics being initiated at any point. While WBC levels are documented as normal (8.4 and 5.1 x10^9/L), there is no explicit reference to lactate levels or a decision to discontinue antibiotics. The discharge plan lists continued home medications but does not include antibiotics, consistent with \\'not discharged on antibiotics.\\' However, the summary does not explicitly state that they were started and then stopped due to normal labs, creating ambiguity about whether antibiotics were ever administered. The absence of clear initiation and discontinuation documentation warrants a 0.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 12, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was discharged on TPN with instructions to follow up in 4 weeks  \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary looking for explicit mention of discharge on TPN with 4 week follow up instructions. Here\\'s my step by step analysis: 1. The summary clearly indicates the patient was discharged on TPN: Under Problem #3, it states \\'Discharged home on cyclic TPN via Soleo Health Infusion\\' The discharge plan mentions TPN continuation 2. However, regarding follow up timing: The summary mentions follow up with Dr. Schipper\\'s office but does not specify a 4 week timeframe No other mentions of a 4 week follow up period appear anywhere in the text 3. While the TPN discharge component is present, the specific 4 week follow up instruction is not mentioned. Since both components must be present to consider the fact fully mentioned, this results in a 0.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient was discharged on cyclic TPN via Soleo Health Infusion with specific details about the TPN formulation. It also mentions follow up instructions, including continued TPN management via Soleo Health Infusion. However, it does not explicitly state that the patient was instructed to follow up in 4 weeks. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists \\'Continued TPN management via Soleo Health Infusion\\' and other follow up instructions but does not specify a timeline of 4 weeks for follow up.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient was discharged on TPN (mentioned multiple times in discharge plans and problem summaries). However, the specific instruction to \\'follow up in 4 weeks\\' is not found. Follow up instructions mention coordination with Dr. Schipper\\'s office and Soleo Health Infusion for TPN management, but no timeframe (e.g., \\'4 weeks\\') is specified. The only 4 week reference relates to Aetna insurance denial resolution, unrelated to TPN follow up. Thus, while TPN at discharge is confirmed, the 4 week follow up component of the fact is absent.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact is partially but not fully mentioned in the summary. Let\\'s break down the key components: 1. Patient with breast cancer: Yes, confirmed as \\'inflammatory breast cancer\\' 2. Bilateral mastectomy: Yes, explicitly mentioned as \\'bilateral complete mastectomy\\' performed on 06/21/2023 3. Unremarkable post operative course: No, the course was actually notable for several complications: Episode of blurry vision, tachycardia, and panic attack High lidocaine levels (58.0 ug/mL) Persistent hypertension and hyperglycemia Skin blistering on coccyx 4. Discharge home: While discharge planning is discussed, the actual discharge and destination are not explicitly mentioned in the summary While the patient did have breast cancer and underwent bilateral mastectomy, the post operative course was not unremarkable, and discharge home is not explicitly confirmed. Therefore, the complete fact as stated is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions the bilateral mastectomy and discharge planning but does not describe the postoperative course as \\'unremarkable.\\' The summary details complications including lidocaine toxicity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and skin reaction, which contradict an unremarkable course. While discharge plans are implied (e.g., follow up instructions, oral medication transitions), the phrase \\'discharge home\\' is not explicitly stated. However, the key disqualifier is the presence of postoperative complications, making the full fact (including \\'unremarkable\\' course) unmentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the summary systematically to determine if it explicitly states that chronic medical conditions, including DM2, were not worsened perioperatively. Here\\'s my analysis: 1. The summary does discuss Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Problem #4) and shows: Elevated glucose readings (139 245 mg/dL) Persistent hyperglycemia requiring management Need for sliding scale insulin during stay Listed as an \\'Outstanding Issue\\' requiring optimization 2. Rather than indicating stability or lack of worsening, the summary actually suggests some perioperative challenges with glycemic control 3. For other chronic conditions like hypertension, the summary also indicates perioperative worsening with elevated readings 4. Nowhere in the text is there an explicit statement or clear indication that chronic conditions, including DM2, remained stable or were not worsened perioperatively 5. In fact, the evidence points to some degree of perioperative deterioration in glycemic control\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions persistent hyperglycemia (Problem #4) and hypertension (Problem #3) during the perioperative period, with both requiring follow up for optimization. However, there is no explicit statement indicating that these chronic conditions (including DM2) were not worsened perioperatively. While the text documents ongoing management and persistence of these issues, it does not affirmatively state that they remained stable or unchanged from baseline. The absence of such a declaration, combined with documented uncontrolled hyperglycemia and hypertension, suggests the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of viral gastroenteritis as the principal diagnosis at discharge. While the patient presented with symptoms that could be consistent with gastroenteritis (nausea and vomiting), and these symptoms resolved with supportive care, the summary does not specifically state that viral gastroenteritis was the principal or final diagnosis. In fact, the summary suggests that these symptoms were potentially related to other conditions, as evidenced by: 1) The initial empiric treatment for suspected UTI (later ruled out), 2) The presence of acute kidney injury and metabolic acidosis, which could explain the symptoms, and 3) An incidental finding of esophageal wall thickening that was noted for follow up. The summary organizes the hospital course by problems but does not definitively state a principal diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis anywhere in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' as the principal diagnosis at discharge. The summary describes the patient\\'s admission with nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and acute kidney injury, and attributes the nausea and vomiting to supportive care resolution without specifying a viral gastroenteritis diagnosis. While the patient presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, the summary does not directly link these symptoms to viral gastroenteritis. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' as the principal diagnosis at discharge. The patient was admitted for nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and AKI. While the nausea/vomiting resolved with supportive care, the text attributes the AKI to pre renal causes/ATN and does not identify a specific etiology (e.g., viral infection) for the gastrointestinal symptoms. The summary explicitly states that empiric antibiotics were discontinued as infection was ruled out, further undermining an infectious gastrointestinal diagnosis. No mention of viral testing (e.g., stool studies), nor any synonym for gastroenteritis (e.g., \\'viral enteritis,\\' \\'stomach flu\\') appears in the text. The discharge focus is on resolving AKI and managing chronic conditions, not a viral GI illness.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the summary for evidence of persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups. Here\\'s my step by step analysis: 1. Persistent fever is clearly documented: Patient had recurrent fevers throughout admission Documented fevers on 08/05/2023 and 08/06/2023 Listed as an outstanding issue (\\'Etiology of persistent fever\\') 2. Negative infectious workups are documented: Blood cultures: No growth Urinalysis: Negative for infection Respiratory viral panel: Negative Initial CXR showed only atelectasis, no consolidation 3. However, while there is suspicion for infection (patient on broad spectrum antibiotics), there is no specific mention of suspected pulmonary infection: The CT chest is pending but reason for ordering isn\\'t specified Initial CXR showed only atelectasis Differential includes tumor fever and methotrexate related fever No explicit mention of suspected pneumonia or pulmonary infection While fever persists despite negative workups, the specific element of suspected pulmonary infection is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'intermittent\\' and \\'recurrent\\' fevers persisting despite antibiotics. It documents multiple negative infectious workups (blood cultures, urinalysis, CXR, CT abdomen/pelvis, respiratory viral panel). However, while a CT chest was ordered to investigate the fever, there is no explicit mention of \\'suspected pulmonary infection\\' as a clinical consideration. The differentials listed are tumor fever and methotrexate related fever, not pulmonary infection. Though pulmonary imaging was pending, the absence of direct clinical suspicion for a pulmonary source meets the threshold for 0 under the guidelines.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 18, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact \\'Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\' can be analyzed in two parts: 1. AKI resolution: This is explicitly mentioned in Problem #3, stating \\'AKI resolved\\' and showing improvement in creatinine from 0.80 mg/dL to 0.52 mg/dL. 2. Hypokalemia resolution: The summary clearly indicates that hypokalemia did NOT resolve. It states \\'mild hypokalemia persisted despite oral and IV repletion\\' in the brief description, and Problem #3 notes \\'Mild hypokalemia persists despite repletion\\' with potassium remaining low at 3.3 mmol/L on 08/05/2023 and 08/06/2023. Since the fact requires both AKI and hypokalemia to resolve, and only the AKI resolved while hypokalemia persisted, the complete fact as stated is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient had an \\'admission acute kidney injury\\' which \\'resolved with IV fluids.\\' It also states that \\'mild hypokalemia persisted despite oral and IV repletion.\\' Under Problem #3: Acute Kidney Injury (Resolved) & Hypokalemia, it is further detailed that the AKI resolved, and although potassium levels remained low, they were being managed with supplementation. The fact that the acute kidney injury resolved is directly stated, and while hypokalemia persisted at the time of the last note, the summary indicates that it was being managed and does not explicitly state that it resolved. However, the fact to be verified is whether \\'Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission,\\' which requires both conditions to be resolved. The summary indicates the AKI resolved but does not confirm resolution of hypokalemia; it actually indicates the opposite under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' and \\'Problem #3,\\' where it is listed as \\'persistent mild hypokalemia.\\' Thus, the specific fact that both AKI and hypokalemia resolved is not supported because hypokalemia did not resolve.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states that the acute kidney injury (AKI) resolved with IV fluids. However, it specifies that hypokalemia persisted despite oral and IV repletion, as noted in Problem #3\\'s \\'Current Clinical Status\\' and \\'Outstanding/Pending Issues.\\' While AKI resolution is confirmed, hypokalemia is documented as unresolved. The fact requires both AKI and hypokalemia to have resolved, but only AKI met this criterion. Therefore, the specific fact is not fully mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 19, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis).\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I will analyze whether the fact \\'Hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis)\\' is explicitly mentioned in the summary. Let\\'s break this down: 1. Hydronephrosis presence: The summary mentions \\'bilateral hydronephrosis\\' in both the CT findings and medical history 2. UTI presence: Current admission is for UTI Current culture shows Enterococcus faecalis Medical history section mentions \\'Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs), including prior ESBL E. coli (01/2023) and Klebsiella (02/2023)\\' 3. Connection between hydronephrosis and UTIs: While both conditions are present, the summary does not explicitly state that the hydronephrosis is complicated by the UTIs The causal or complicating relationship between these conditions is not directly addressed While all the individual components (hydronephrosis and the specific organisms) are mentioned, the specific statement that hydronephrosis is complicated by these infections is not explicitly made. Therefore, despite the presence of related information, the exact fact as stated is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 19, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Chronic opioid use and opioid-related constipation. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'Chronic Pain / Chronic Opioid Use\\' (Problem #2), including details about hydromorphone use and a history of non prescribed opioid use. It also lists \\'Chronic Constipation\\' (Problem #8) as a separate issue, with interventions like bowel regimens. However, the summary does not explicitly state that the constipation is opioid related. While both components of the fact (chronic opioid use and chronic constipation) are present, the causal or associative link between them is not explicitly documented. A busy physician would recognize the potential association but would not find an explicit statement connecting the two in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact about worsening thrombocytopenia and prednisone taper initiation is partially present but not exactly as stated. The summary does mention \\'progressive thrombocytopenia\\' and documents worsening with specific platelet counts (from OSH showing nadir of 42, and SUH values showing 72→64→67→82). However, rather than a prednisone taper initiation, the summary describes a prednisone dose INCREASE from 40mg to 100mg daily on 05/13/2023. This is actually the opposite of a taper. Since the fact specifically looks for \\'taper initiation\\' and the summary shows a dose increase instead, this cannot be considered an exact match.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s treatment for thrombocytopenia, including the administration of prednisone. Initially, the patient was on prednisone 40mg daily, which was increased to 100mg daily on 05/13/2023. The summary explicitly states that the patient was treated for thrombocytopenia with an increased dose of prednisone, and platelet counts improved from 64 to 82. However, it does not explicitly mention a \\'prednisone taper initiation.\\' The discharge plan includes continuing prednisone 100mg QAM, indicating that the treatment was ongoing at discharge, but a taper was planned as it mentions \\'Continue prednisone 100mg QAM with breakfast\\' without specifying a reduction in dosage at discharge. The fact of \\'worsening thrombocytopenia\\' is implicitly addressed as the patient had \\'progressive thrombocytopenia\\' and was treated for it, showing improvement with the increased prednisone dose.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly mentions \\'progressive thrombocytopenia\\' under Problem #2, which is a clear synonym for \\'worsening thrombocytopenia.\\' 2. The text states prednisone was \\'increased to 100mg daily starting 05/13/2023\\' but does not mention a prednisone taper (i.e., gradual dose reduction). The term \\'taper initiation\\' implies starting a dose reduction, whereas the summary describes a dose escalation. No equivalent phrasing for a taper is present. 3. While thrombocytopenia improvement is noted, the specific combination of \\'worsening thrombocytopenia\\' and \\'s/p prednisone taper initiation\\' is not fully addressed. The prednisone dose increase (not taper) is explicitly documented, but the taper itself is absent.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 20, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary in detail, particularly focusing on the discharge plans and follow up sections, there is no explicit mention of ordering twice weekly CBCs after discharge. While the summary does mention \\'Follow up CBC\\' under Problem #2 (Thrombocytopenia) in the discharge plan, it does not specify the frequency of these follow up CBCs. Given the patient\\'s thrombocytopenia and its monitoring during admission (with serial CBCs showing values of 72, 64, 67, and 82), one might expect regular CBC monitoring after discharge, but the specific instruction for twice weekly CBCs is not explicitly stated anywhere in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if it explicitly mentions ordering twice weekly CBCs after discharge. Under \\'Problem #2: Thrombocytopenia\\', the \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' section states \\'Follow up CBC.\\' This indicates a plan for CBC follow up post discharge, but it does not specify the frequency as \\'twice weekly\\'. The summary does not explicitly mention \\'twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\', so the fact is not clearly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'Follow up CBC\\' under the Discharge Plan and Goals for Problem #2 (Thrombocytopenia). However, there is no mention of the frequency (twice weekly) for these CBCs. The summary specifies follow up with Hematology and pending tests but does not state any schedule for CBC monitoring post discharge. While CBC follow up is mentioned, the required frequency of twice weekly is absent from the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I find that while recurrent falls are mentioned multiple times, there is no explicit statement about them being of unknown etiology despite extensive workup. Here\\'s my analysis: 1. Falls are mentioned in multiple sections: Initial admission reason (\\'admitted due to recurrent falls\\') Problem #1 discusses the falls and their immediate consequence (T6 compression fracture) Listed in follow up issues 2. The workup described includes: CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis CT Head/Cervical Spine Physical Therapy Evaluation 3. However, nowhere does the summary state that: The falls were of unknown etiology An extensive workup failed to determine the cause The falls remained unexplained despite investigation While multiple evaluations were performed, the summary doesn\\'t specifically indicate that the etiology remained unknown or that the workup was extensive yet inconclusive.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient was admitted for \\'recurrent falls\\' and details the diagnostic workup performed (CT head/cervical spine, physical therapy evaluation, cardiac monitoring, etc.). However, it does not explicitly state that the etiology of the falls remains \\'despite extensive workup.\\' While the workup identified contributing factors (e.g., T6 fracture, dementia, HFrEF), there is no documentation indicating that the root cause of the falls was undetermined after evaluation. The summary focuses on managing consequences and risk factors rather than declaring the etiology unknown.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention that the T6 wedge compression fracture existed prior to the most recent fall. The summary indicates: 1. The patient was admitted on 03/14/2023 due to recurrent falls, which led to an acute T6 compression fracture 2. Under Problem #1, it\\'s described as an \\'interval anterior wedge compression deformity of T6\\' found on CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis (03/14/2023) 3. The term \\'interval\\' typically suggests a new finding, and the fracture is specifically described as \\'acute\\' 4. While the patient has a history of recurrent falls, there is no documentation suggesting this particular fracture predated the most recent fall In fact, the description of it as an \\'acute\\' fracture that \\'led to\\' the admission suggests this was a new injury from the recent fall.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient was admitted due to recurrent falls, which led to an acute T6 compression fracture. The summary under \\'Problem #1: T6 Compression Fracture and Recurrent Falls\\' describes the T6 compression fracture as an \\'Interval anterior wedge compression deformity of T6\\' identified on the CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis done on 03/14/2023. However, it does not explicitly state whether the T6 wedge compression fracture happened before or after the most recent fall. The summary implies a causal relationship between the recurrent falls and the T6 compression fracture but does not directly address the timing relative to \\'most recent fall.\\' Despite this, the fact that it is described as \\'acute\\' suggests it happened recently, potentially in conjunction with or due to the recent falls. The summary does not provide a clear statement that the fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall.\\'\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient was admitted due to recurrent falls leading to an acute T6 compression fracture . The CT findings describe an \\'interval anterior wedge compression deformity of T6,\\' where \\'interval\\' in radiology typically indicates a new finding compared to prior imaging. However, the summary does not mention prior imaging results, pre existing T6 fractures, or any clinical indication that the fracture predated the most recent fall. The fracture is consistently attributed to the falls prompting admission. While \\'wedge compression fracture\\' is mentioned, there is no explicit statement or implication that it occurred before the most recent fall. The term \\'acute\\' further supports its association with the current presentation rather than a pre existing injury.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 22, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of cholangitis occurring after a recent biliary stent exchange. While the patient does have cholangitis (Problem #1 clearly documents this), and there is mention of biliary interventions in the surgical history (including ERCP with stent placement on 11/14/2022 and IR biliary drain placement/revision), the summary does not explicitly state that the current cholangitis episode was a post procedural complication of a recent stent exchange. The temporal relationship between any stent procedures and the current cholangitis is not clearly established. The cholangitis appears to be related to biliary drain malfunction rather than a stent exchange complication, as evidenced by the improvement after uncapping the PTBD.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s admission for fever, abdominal pain, and purulent drainage from biliary drain sites, concerning for cholangitis. The patient had a history of recurrent colon adenocarcinoma with liver metastasis and had undergone several procedures, including ERCP with stent placement on 11/14/2022 and IR biliary drain placement on 11/23/2022, which was revised on 12/25/2022. The summary explicitly mentions the patient\\'s presentation and treatment for cholangitis but does not directly state that the cholangitis occurred post procedurally following a recent biliary stent exchange. However, it implies a temporal relationship between the biliary drain revision (12/25/2022) and the admission (12/27/2022) for cholangitis. The fact that the biliary drain was revised just before admission and the patient presented with symptoms of cholangitis suggests a possible post procedural cholangitis. The summary does mention \\'biliary drain malfunction\\' under Problem #1, which could be interpreted as related to the recent biliary drain revision. Thus, while not directly stated, there are strong contextual clues suggesting the cholangitis could be post procedural. However, the specific fact \\'post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary describes cholangitis in the context of biliary drain malfunction and E. coli bacteremia. While it details recent biliary drain placement (11/23/2022) and revision (12/25/2022), there is no explicit mention of a biliary stent exchange procedure occurring immediately before the onset of cholangitis. The term \\'stent exchange\\' does not appear in the text, and the cholangitis is attributed to drain related issues rather than a stent related procedure. The ERCP with stent placement noted in the surgical history occurred over a month prior (11/14/2022), which is not considered \\'recent\\' in this admission\\'s context (12/27/2022). The absence of direct reference to a post stent exchange complication leads to the conclusion that this specific fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of re evaluating Augmentin therapy prior to a 14 day completion. The summary discusses antibiotic therapy, but specifically mentions piperacillin tazobactam as the antibiotic being used, not Augmentin. Under Problem #1 (Cholangitis and Biliary Drain Malfunction), the discharge plan states \\'Continue piperacillin tazobactam to complete course\\' but does not mention Augmentin or any need to re evaluate the duration. While antibiotic completion is listed as an outstanding issue, there is no specific mention of Augmentin or a 14 day course re evaluation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'should continue and re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, it is noted that the patient was initiated on intravenous piperacillin tazobactam for cholangitis and E. coli bacteremia. The discharge plan under Problem #1: Cholangitis and Biliary Drain Malfunction mentions \\'Continue piperacillin tazobactam to complete course.\\' However, there is no mention of \\'Augmentin\\' therapy in the entire summary. Augmentin is a different antibiotic (amoxicillin clavulanate), and its continuation is not discussed. Therefore, the specific fact regarding Augmentin therapy is not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states that the patient was treated with piperacillin tazobactam (not Augmentin) for E. coli bacteremia/cholangitis and specifies plans to \\'continue piperacillin tazobactam to complete course.\\' The summary does not mention Augmentin (amoxicillin clavulanate) at any point, nor does it describe a plan to re evaluate antibiotic therapy prior to completing the 14 day duration. The antibiotic in use and the re evaluation instruction for Augmentin are absent from the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 22, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** patient should follow up with Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/ Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Poultsides, George, MD in in 2 weeks\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of follow up appointments with either an Advanced Practice Provider in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. While the summary does mention several follow up needs (such as with Radiation Oncology, Registered Dietitian, Speech Language Pathologist, and for diabetes management), it does not specify these particular provider appointments or their timing. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists various follow up needs but does not include these specific appointments. The absence of these particular follow up instructions in what appears to be a comprehensive discharge summary suggests these specific appointments were either not scheduled or not documented in this summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, treatment, and follow up plans. To determine if the specific fact about follow up appointments is mentioned, we need to look for any reference to follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider (APP) or Dr. Poultsides. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists various follow up plans but does not explicitly mention follow up with an APP in 1 week or Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' section details the patient\\'s issues and follow up plans for each problem but still lacks the specific follow up information we\\'re looking for. Since there\\'s no explicit mention of the required follow up appointments with the specified individuals within the given timeframe, we conclude that the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary\\'s \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section and discharge plans mention multiple follow up appointments (e.g., Radiation Oncology, Registered Dietitian, Speech Language Pathologist) but do not explicitly state follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider (APP) in 1 week or Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. While Dr. Poultsides is listed in the surgical history as the provider for prior biliary drain placement, there is no direct instruction for a follow up with him in 2 weeks post discharge. Similarly, no APP follow up is specified. The summary only refers to \\'close outpatient follow up\\' generally, without naming these specific clinicians or their timelines.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 23, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, it is evident that the patient has a diagnosis of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and mitral valvulopathy (specifically mitral stenosis). The summary under \\'Relevant Medical History\\' mentions Rai Stage II CLL, and under \\'Problem #3: Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) & Worsening Mitral Stenosis\\', it discusses the patient\\'s worsening mitral stenosis. Although the exact phrase \\'in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\' is not directly stated, the context of both conditions being relevant to the patient\\'s hospital course is present. The hospital course summary discusses the management of CLL and its complications, as well as the worsening mitral stenosis. Therefore, while the exact phrase is not mentioned, the clinical context of both progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy is discussed.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 23, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find any explicit mention of cardiology coordinating follow up with the Heart Failure team for transcatheter MVR or discussion of a new clinical trial drug for 4/2023. While the summary does mention cardiology follow up for worsening mitral stenosis and plans for a repeat TTE once euvolemic (under Problem #3 and in Outstanding Issues/Follow Up), it does not specify the detailed plan mentioned in the fact. The only cardiology related follow up mentioned is more general in nature. The summary discusses the patient\\'s mitral valve issues and documents worsening stenosis (gradient increase from 11mmHg to 25mmHg), but does not mention any specific plans for transcatheter MVR or clinical trial participation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if it mentions that \\'Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\'. The summary does not explicitly state this fact. Under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\', it is mentioned that there will be \\'Cardiology follow up for worsening mitral stenosis; plan for repeat TTE once euvolemic.\\' While this indicates a follow up with cardiology regarding mitral stenosis, it does not mention a Heart Failure team, transcatheter MVR, or a new clinical trial drug. Thus, the specific fact is not mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions cardiology follow up for worsening mitral stenosis and plans for a repeat TTE once euvolemic. However, there is no explicit mention of coordination with the Heart Failure team, transcatheter MVR, or a new clinical trial drug in April 2023. The cardiology follow up focuses on reassessment via imaging and standard management, without referencing specific interventions, trials, or drugs related to transcatheter MVR. The absence of these key components indicates the fact is not stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 24, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary for explicit mention of discharge on full liquid diet and oral pain medications. Here\\'s my step by step analysis: 1. Regarding diet status: The summary shows the patient was advanced to full liquids on 8/19/2023 The discharge plan mentions \\'Advance diet from full liquids as tolerated\\' However, it does not explicitly state the diet status at discharge 2. Regarding pain medications: While IV Acetaminophen is mentioned during the hospital stay The discharge plan does not explicitly mention oral pain medications There is no clear statement about pain medication prescriptions at discharge While the patient was on a full liquid diet during the stay and had pain management, the specific combination of being discharged on full liquid diet AND oral pain medications is not explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The \\'full liquid diet\\' component is explicitly mentioned multiple times in the discharge plans (e.g., \\'started on full liquid diet\\' in Problem #2\\'s Current Clinical Status and \\'Advance diet from full liquids\\' in Problem #1\\'s Discharge Plan). 2. The \\'oral pain medications\\' component is not explicitly stated. While IV Acetaminophen is listed under medications during admission, the discharge plan only mentions \\'supportive medications (Zofran, Reglan PRN)\\'—both antiemetics, not pain medications. No pain medications (oral or otherwise) are specified in the discharge instructions. 3. Since only one part of the fact (diet) is confirmed and the other (oral pain medications) is absent, the full fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 25, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact about AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved is partially mentioned in the hospital course summary, but not exactly as stated. The only reference to AKI appears in Problem #1 under the discharge plan, which mentions \\'(held temporarily during AKI)\\' in reference to furosemide and spironolactone medications. However, the summary does not explicitly state that the AKI was present on admission, nor does it mention that it was treated with fluids or that it resolved. While AKI occurred during the hospitalization, the specific details about its timing, treatment with fluids, and resolution are not explicitly documented in the provided summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient had \\'AKI\\' (Acute Kidney Injury) and that \\'furosemide 20mg daily and spironolactone 25mg daily\\' were \\'held temporarily during AKI.\\' This indicates that the patient experienced AKI during their hospital stay. The summary also states that these medications were \\'held temporarily during AKI,\\' implying that the AKI was managed or treated, and the fact that they were resumed suggests that the AKI resolved. Although the summary does not explicitly state that fluids were used to treat the AKI, it is a reasonable inference that the holding of diuretics (furosemide and spironolactone) during AKI implies a treatment approach that likely included fluid management or administration, which is a common practice in treating AKI. However, the explicit mention of \\'fluids\\' is not present. The fact that the diuretics were held and then resumed implies resolution of AKI. Thus, while the treatment with fluids is not explicitly mentioned, the context suggests AKI was present on admission and resolved.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions AKI in Problem #1\\'s discharge plan: \\'Continue furosemide 20mg daily and spironolactone 25mg daily (held temporarily during AKI).\\' However, there is no explicit documentation of AKI being present on admission, nor any description of fluid administration as treatment for AKI. The resolution of AKI is implied by the resumption of diuretics but not directly stated. The summary focuses on AKI only in the context of medication management, without addressing onset timing, treatment specifics, or resolution details required by the target fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact is indeed mentioned in the hospital course summary, specifically in the Problem #1 section under \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results.\\' The CT Abdomen Pelvis Angiography from 01/26/2023 revealed \\'Moderate narrowing of the proximal superior mesenteric artery.\\' While the summary explicitly states \\'no evidence of acute mesenteric ischemia,\\' the presence of SMA stenosis is clearly documented. The patient\\'s presenting symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are also documented. However, the summary specifically notes that \\'no cause identified for abdominal pain\\' and attributes the symptoms to gastritis/dyspepsia/gastroparesis rather than chronic mesenteric ischemia. While the anatomical finding (SMA stenosis) is present, the clinical correlation suggesting that the emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia is not explicitly made in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient underwent a CT Abdomen Pelvis Angiography on 01/26/2023, which revealed \\'Moderate narrowing of the proximal superior mesenteric artery, no evidence of acute mesenteric ischemia.\\' The summary also documents the patient\\'s presenting symptoms of nausea and vomiting, which resolved by 01/29/2023. However, it does not explicitly state that the patient\\'s emesis is related to chronic mesenteric ischemia. The fact that the SMA stenosis was noted but not directly linked to the patient\\'s symptoms in the provided text is crucial. The discharge plan includes follow up with Gastroenterology for recurrence of epigastric pain and consideration for a repeat gastroparesis nuclear medicine study if symptoms recur, indicating ongoing gastrointestinal issues but not directly attributing them to SMA stenosis or chronic mesenteric ischemia.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions CT angiography showing \\'moderate narrowing of the proximal superior mesenteric artery\\' (SMA stenosis) in Problem #1. However, it specifically states \\'no evidence of acute mesenteric ischemia\\' and concludes \\'no cause identified for abdominal pain.\\' While SMA stenosis is documented, there is no explicit statement linking the emesis to chronic mesenteric ischemia. The clinical team attributed gastrointestinal symptoms to gastritis/dyspepsia/gastroparesis and resolved them with standard therapies. The summary does not propose chronic mesenteric ischemia as an explanatory mechanism for the vomiting at any point.\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions the patient was admitted for neutropenic fever and had Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) bacteremia treated with PICC line removal and antibiotics. However, the fact specifies \\'coagulase negative strep\\' (streptococcus), while the summary identifies the pathogen as Staphylococcus (a different genus). Since \\'strep\\' and \\'staph\\' are distinct organisms and not clinical synonyms, the exact fact (strep bacteremia) is not mentioned. All other components (neutropenic fever, PICC removal, antibiotics) are present, but the discrepancy in the bacterial genus precludes marking this as explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**34. Patient 28, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, the specific fact about PTBD exchange on 4/21/23 is not explicitly mentioned. While the summary does describe a PTBD exchange, it occurred on 4/8/2023, not 4/21/2023. Here\\'s the step by step analysis: 1. The summary mentions multiple PTBD related events: Initial PTBD placement on 3/17/2023 PTBD exchange on 3/25/2023 PTBD exchange on 4/8/2023 (from 14Fr to 16Fr) 2. The patient was discharged to home hospice on 4/12/2023, which is before the date in question (4/21/23) 3. While the patient did have recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchanges, the specific exchange mentioned for 4/21/23 is not documented in this hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient was admitted for biliary obstruction, weakness, hyperbilirubinemia, dehydration, and hypotension. It further details that the patient underwent an Interventional Radiology guided exchange and upsizing of his left percutaneous transhepatic biliary drain (PTBD) to a 16Fr catheter on 04/08/2023. However, the specific date mentioned in the fact to look for is 4/21/23, which is not present in the provided summary. The summary does mention a PTBD exchange on 04/08/2023, but it does not mention any procedure on 4/21/23. Therefore, the fact \\'Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient was admitted for recurrent cholangiocarcinoma (a type of malignant biliary obstruction) with hyperbilirubinemia and underwent a PTBD exchange on 04/08/2023. However, the specific date mentioned in the fact (04/21/2023) does not appear in the summary. The PTBD exchange occurred during the hospitalization (04/08/2023), and the date discrepancy likely represents a typo or error in the fact. All other components of the fact (recurrent malignant biliary obstruction, hyperbilirubinemia, PTBD exchange) are clearly documented. However, since the date in the fact (04/21/2023) is explicitly stated and does not match the documented procedure date (04/08/2023), the fact as written is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**35. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, the stated fact is not fully accurate according to the text. The summary actually indicates that the bilirubin DID improve after PTBD exchange, though the improvement was partial. Specifically, the summary states \\'Serial Labs: Total Bilirubin trended down from 16.8 mg/dL (04/06) to 10.8 mg/dL (04/11)\\' and mentions \\'gradual improvement in bilirubin levels.\\' While the patient did transition to home hospice (confirmed in multiple places in the summary), this was not due to failed bilirubin improvement but rather appears to be related to overall clinical decline, including factors such as delirium, persistent oliguria, and poor oral intake. The decision for hospice appears to have been made after palliative care consultation and family discussions about goals of care, not specifically due to failed biliary drainage.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary indicates that the patient underwent a PTBD exchange on 04/08/2023, after which \\'bilirubin levels\\' showed \\'gradual improvement.\\' Specifically, Total Bilirubin trended down from 16.8 mg/dL on 04/06 to 10.8 mg/dL on 04/11. This directly contradicts the statement that \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange.\\' Furthermore, the summary states that the patient was discharged to home hospice on 04/12/2023, which aligns with the second part of the fact in question. Therefore, the fact that \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice\\' is not entirely accurate because while the patient was transitioned to home hospice, bilirubin levels did show improvement post PTBD exchange.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly states that after PTBD exchange on 04/08/2023, the patient\\'s bilirubin levels trended down from 16.8 mg/dL (04/06) to 10.8 mg/dL (04/11), with documentation of \\'gradual improvement in bilirubin levels\\' and \\'hyperbilirubinemia improving but persistent.\\' This directly contradicts the first part of the fact (\\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange\\'). 2. The second part of the fact (\\'pt/family opted to transition to home hospice\\') is explicitly confirmed in multiple sections, including the discharge plan and problem based summaries. 3. While the transition to hospice is documented, the claim that bilirubin \\'did not improve\\' is explicitly refuted by the data. Since both components of the fact must be present for a 1, and the first component is contradicted, the fact as a whole is not mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**36. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze each component of the fact: 1. Sepsis requiring antibiotics and fluid resuscitation: The summary mentions antibiotics (piperacillin tazobactam) and IV fluids were given However, while there are signs suggesting possible sepsis (elevated WBC, hypotension), sepsis is not explicitly diagnosed or mentioned 2. Delirium requiring pharmacotherapy: Delirium is explicitly mentioned as a complication post procedure Pharmacotherapy is mentioned (mirtazapine, melatonin) 3. Urinary retention requiring catheter: While a Foley catheter is mentioned, it was placed in the context of oliguria monitoring Urinary retention is not explicitly mentioned as a diagnosis or complication While some elements are present (delirium with medication, catheter placement), the complete combination of all three complications exactly as specified (particularly sepsis and urinary retention) is not explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis requiring antibiotics/fluids : The summary mentions antibiotics (piperacillin tazobactam) and IV hydration, but does not explicitly state \\'sepsis\\' or a synonymous term. Treatment for \\'presumed cholangitis\\' is noted, which may overlap with sepsis management, but sepsis itself is not clearly documented. 2. Delirium requiring pharmacotherapy : Delirium is explicitly stated, and mirtazapine/melatonin were used. This meets the criteria. 3. Urinary retention requiring catheter : A Foley catheter was placed for \\'persistent oliguria,\\' but the summary does not explicitly mention \\'urinary retention\\' as the indication. Oliguria (low urine output) may have multiple causes (e.g., dehydration, renal dysfunction) and is not equivalent to urinary retention (inability to void). Conclusion: Only delirium with pharmacotherapy is explicitly documented. Sepsis and urinary retention are not directly stated, so the full fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**37. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states that definitive treatment decisions for nasopharyngeal carcinoma are pending improved delirium and outpatient oncology consultation. It specifically mentions \\'Son to discuss treatment options with patient when delirium fully resolves\\' in the discharge plan. While this indicates family involvement and a delay due to delirium, the summary does not explicitly state that the deferral of management was made \\'per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes.\\' The deferral is attributed to the patient\\'s cognitive status (delirium) and the need for outpatient follow up, but the son\\'s direct influence on the decision making process (i.e., \\'per son\\'s wishes\\') is not clearly documented. Thus, the exact phrasing or equivalent of the specified fact is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n### B.

All Inconsistent Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 2, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed. Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'Adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down\\' and \\'obstructing necrotic mass were removed\\' followed by small bowel resection. 2. Hospital Summary explicitly documents \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' and removal of a \\'necrotic\\' small bowel mass, confirming the second part. 3. However, the summary contains no mention of adhesions involving the omentum/abdominal wall being addressed during surgery. The absence of this specific procedural detail in the summary creates a direct contradiction with the Important Fact\\'s first component.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 3, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** R-sided chest pain 2/2 port-associated thrombus\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states R sided chest pain is secondary to port associated thrombus (2/2). 2. The Hospital Course Summary attributes R sided chest pain to both the port associated thrombus and metastatic disease progression in multiple sections (Admission Reason, Problem #1, Problem #3). 3. Attributing pain to two distinct etiologies (thrombus + metastases) directly conflicts with the claim that it is solely due to the thrombus (2/2 relationship).\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient was admitted with adrenal crisis and received stress dose IV hydrocortisone. The patient was transitioned to a tapering oral steroid regimen upon discharge. The Important Fact states that the adrenal crisis was likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. However, the Hospital Course Summary does not mention PO prednisone intolerance; instead, it details the patient\\'s treatment with IV hydrocortisone and subsequent tapering of oral hydrocortisone, not prednisone. This discrepancy suggests a contradiction between the summary and the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary indicates patient was transitioned to Levemir 16 units BID (twice daily) 2. The Important Fact states lantus 15 units twice daily 3. While both are long acting insulins given twice daily, they are different medications (Levemir vs Lantus) at different doses (16 vs 15 units) 4. These specific details directly contradict each other\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions that the patient was transitioned to a subcutaneous insulin regimen on 01/24, which included \\'Levemir 16 units BID\\'. The Important Fact states that insulin was changed to \\'lantus 15units twice a day\\'. Lantus and Levemir are both long acting insulin analogs, but they are not the same medication. Lantus is insulin glargine, while Levemir is insulin detemir. The dosage mentioned is also different (15 units vs 16 units). Therefore, the summary contradicts the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states insulin was changed to Lantus 15 units BID. 2. Hospital summary (Problem #4) specifies \\'Levemir 16 units BID\\' as the basal insulin regimen. 3. Levemir (insulin detemir) and Lantus (insulin glargine) are distinct long acting insulins. 4. Both drug name and dose (16 vs 15 units) differ from the stated fact, creating a direct contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 7, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left renal cell carcinoma status-post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post-op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\' for left renal cell carcinoma. 2. The Hospital Course Summary under Problem #1 lists \\'Cabozantinib (home immunotherapy) held perioperatively\\' but contains no documentation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy administration prior to the 05/11/2023 nephrectomy. 3. Cabozantinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (targeted therapy), not traditional chemotherapy, and the summary explicitly describes it as immunotherapy. 4. No other chemotherapy agents or regimens are mentioned in the perioperative management or preoperative workup sections.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 7, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second-line\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the patient had a hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo (immunotherapy) and was switched to cabozantinib second line. 2. The Hospital Summary under Problem #1 notes \\'Cabozantinib (home immunotherapy) held perioperatively,\\' indicating cabozantinib was already part of the home regimen, not initiated second line during/after admission. 3. No mention of ipi/nivo use, hypersensitivity reaction, or a therapy switch exists in the summary. The summary\\'s description of cabozantinib as a pre existing home medication directly conflicts with the fact\\'s assertion of a recent switch due to reaction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 7, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Continued on apixaban post-op\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary indicates the patient was discharged on Lovenox (enoxaparin) for DVT prophylaxis. 2. Problem #7 specifically states \\'discharge plan is Lovenox\\' despite a note about briefly restarting Eliquis. 3. This directly contradicts the Important Fact stating the patient \\'Continued on apixaban post op\\'. 4. The summary clearly shows a different anticoagulation plan was implemented at discharge (Lovenox instead of apixaban).\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that the patient was discharged on Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis, while the Important Fact mentions that the patient was continued on apixaban post op. The summary also notes that the patient\\'s home Eliquis (apixaban) was held perioperatively and the discharge plan was Lovenox, indicating a contradiction between the fact and the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' under Problem #7 states the patient was discharged on Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis. 2. The \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' section explicitly notes \\'Home Eliquis 5mg BID held perioperatively [...] discharge plan is Lovenox\\'. 3. Apixaban (Eliquis) was not continued post op as per discharge documentation, directly conflicting with the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 8, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Down\\'s syndrome, neurogenic bladder, admitted for pneumonia, treated with CAP regimen and vancomycin due to positive sputum culture for MRSA\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'positive sputum culture for MRSA\\' as reason for vancomycin. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s sputum culture (05/30) shows \\'Staph aureus\\' but does not specify MRSA. 3. MRSA nares screen was positive, but this is a nasal swab, not sputum. 4. Summary\\'s antibiotic use (vancomycin) aligns with MRSA coverage, but the documented sputum culture lacks MRSA confirmation, conflicting with the Fact\\'s assertion.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact mentions a potential aspiration event prior to discharge, but the Hospital Course Summary attributes the pneumonia to community acquired pneumonia without documenting any aspiration event. 2. The Summary reports sputum culture (5/30) with Staph aureus (GPC) and pending 6/17 blood cultures, but does not mention 1/4 bottles positive for GPC. The absence of documented positive blood cultures (only \\'no growth\\' and \\'pending\\') conflicts with the Important Fact\\'s assertion of 1/4 bottles positive for GPC.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows the patient was treated with Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam) in the hospital, not Cipro 2. The summary indicates \\'Continue Zosyn pending sensitivities for potential de escalation\\' and does not mention a planned 7 day course of Cipro 3. While finasteride was indeed started for prostatomegaly to prevent future UTIs (consistent), the antibiotic treatment details are clearly different 4. The discharge antibiotic plan was still pending final culture sensitivities, contradicting a definite 7 day Cipro course\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was diagnosed with a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, leading to sepsis and septic encephalopathy, with imaging suggesting developing pyelonephritis. The patient was started on finasteride for presumed prostatomegaly as a contributing factor to UTI. The summary also mentions that the patient was to continue Zosyn pending sensitivities for potential de escalation, indicating ongoing antibiotic treatment. The Important Fact states that the patient was finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge and was started on finasteride to prevent future UTIs. However, the Hospital Course Summary does not mention cipro or a 7 day antibiotic course upon discharge; instead, it mentions continuing Zosyn. This indicates a contradiction between the antibiotic treatment mentioned in the Important Fact and the Hospital Course Summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states patient was \\'finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge\\', but Hospital Summary specifies continued Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam) therapy pending culture sensitivities with no mention of ciprofloxacin in discharge plan. 2. Both cipro and Zosyn are antibiotics simultaneous use of both for same infection would be unusual without documentation. 3. Summary explicitly lists all discharge medications (including finasteride) and antibiotic plan, creating contradiction regarding cipro completion.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 12, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient sent to the hospital from home for symptoms of tachycardia, hypotension, found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula\\n\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The Important Fact states patient was found to have a \\'new gallbladder enteric fistula\\' 2. However, the Hospital Course Summary directly contradicts this in two ways: CT scan \\'showed fluid collection around gallbladder but no clearly visualized fistula\\' Under Problem #2, it notes \\'concern for gallbladder enteric fistula (though not visualized on this admission\\'s CT)\\' 3. The summary indicates only a suspicion/concern for a fistula based on prior imaging (03/11/2024), not a confirmed finding during this admission 4. The fluid collection was noted but explicitly stated to be without visualized fistula\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the patient was found to have a \\'new gallbladder enteric fistula.\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary explicitly notes the CT scan (03/17/2024) showed \\'fluid collection around the gallbladder but no clearly visualized fistula\\' and lists \\'concern for gallbladder enteric fistula (though not visualized on this admission\\'s CT)\\' under Problem #2. 3. The summary directly contradicts the assertion of a new fistula being confirmed during this admission, as imaging did not demonstrate it.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 12, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was started on empiric antibiotics but was found to have a normal WBC with normal lactate and abx were discontinued, he was not discharged on antibiotics\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states antibiotics were started then discontinued due to normal WBC/lactate. 2. Hospital Summary (Problem #1, \\'Infectious workup\\' section) explicitly states \\'no acute infection necessitating empiric antibiotics\\' and \\'no leukocytosis noted on admission\\' (WBC 8.4, normal range). 3. Summary does not mention antibiotics being initiated at any point, directly contradicting the fact\\'s claim of starting then stopping them. 4. Discharge plan confirms no antibiotics prescribed, aligning with the fact\\'s second part but conflicting with the initial antibiotic use claim.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'unremarkable post operative course\\' but the Hospital Course Summary shows several significant complications: Episode of blurry vision, tachycardia, and panic attack Critically high lidocaine level (58.0 ug/mL) Persistent hypertension with concerning readings (up to 202/114) Persistent hyperglycemia Development of skin blistering on coccyx 2. These complications required medication changes, discontinuation of pain management strategy, and additional monitoring/consultations 3. These events constitute a remarkable (noteworthy) post operative course, directly contradicting the statement of an \\'unremarkable post operative course\\'\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient was admitted for bilateral mastectomy with an unremarkable postoperative course and was discharged home. However, the Hospital Course Summary reveals several postoperative complications, including an episode of blurry vision, tachycardia, and panic attack, persistent hypertension, hyperglycemia, and a skin reaction on the coccyx. These complications indicate that the postoperative course was not unremarkable as stated in the Important Fact. Therefore, the summary contradicts the fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'unremarkable post operative course\\' and discharge home. 2. Hospital summary documents multiple complications: lidocaine toxicity (critically high level 58.0 ug/mL with neurological/cardiac symptoms), persistent hypertension (BP up to 202/114 mmHg), persistent hyperglycemia (up to 245 mg/dL), and skin blistering requiring management. 3. These complications required therapeutic interventions (discontinuing infusions, medication adjustments, wound care) and follow up planning, contradicting \\'unremarkable\\' postoperative course.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows DM2 was worsened during the hospital stay: Multiple elevated glucose readings (139 245 mg/dL) were documented Summary explicitly states \\'persistent hyperglycemia\\' despite sliding scale insulin Listed as an outstanding issue requiring \\'optimization of diabetes management plan\\' 2. This directly contradicts the Important Fact stating DM2 was not worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient\\'s chronic medical conditions, including DM2, were not worsened perioperatively. The Hospital Course Summary under Problem #4: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus indicates that \\'Hyperglycemia persisted despite sliding scale insulin\\' and lists \\'Persistent hyperglycemia requiring optimization of diabetes management plan\\' as an outstanding issue. This information directly contradicts the Important Fact because it shows that DM2 was not well controlled perioperatively, implying it was worsened.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states DM2 was not worsened perioperatively. 2. Problem #4 in the summary documents \\'postoperative glucose monitoring: Multiple readings elevated, ranging 139 245 mg/dL\\' and \\'hyperglycemia persisted despite sliding scale insulin\\'. 3. Persistent hyperglycemia requiring optimization in discharge planning indicates worsened glycemic control during the perioperative period. 4. This directly contradicts the assertion that DM2 was not exacerbated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 14, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bevacizumab was initiated during hospitalization\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states bevacizumab was initiated during hospitalization. 2. The Hospital Summary states bevacizumab was referenced in a 04/12/2023 note to start on \\'4/28\\' (after discharge on 04/17/2023). 3. A medication cannot be initiated during hospitalization if its documented start date occurs after discharge. 4. This creates a direct contradiction regarding the timing of bevacizumab administration.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary describes a patient admitted with nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and acute kidney injury. 2. While nausea and vomiting were present, they were attributed to pre renal causes progressing to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). 3. There is no mention of viral gastroenteritis as a diagnosis anywhere in the extensive hospital course. 4. The workup included blood cultures, urine cultures (both negative), and CT imaging, which did not suggest viral gastroenteritis. 5. The symptoms resolved with IV fluids and supportive care, and infection was ruled out (empiric antibiotics were discontinued). 6. The clinical presentation and workup point to ATN as the primary diagnosis, not viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary describes a patient admitted with nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and acute kidney injury (AKI) on chronic kidney disease. The principal diagnosis at discharge is stated as viral gastroenteritis in the Important Fact. The Hospital Course Summary does not mention viral gastroenteritis as a diagnosis; instead, it attributes the patient\\'s nausea and vomiting to other causes and resolves them with supportive care. The summary indicates that the patient\\'s symptoms were managed and resolved without attributing them to viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The principal diagnosis at discharge is listed as viral gastroenteritis. 2. The hospital course attributes nausea/vomiting to resolved symptoms with supportive care and AKI to pre renal causes/ATN, explicitly stating empiric antibiotics were discontinued as infection (including UTI) was ruled out. 3. No mention of viral testing, stool studies, or confirmation of viral etiology for GI symptoms. 4. The documented cause of AKI (ATN from pre renal factors) and lack of infectious confirmation directly contradict viral gastroenteritis as the principal diagnosis.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 18, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma recently complicated by progression to CNS lymphoma\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'recent\\' progression to CNS lymphoma. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s Problem #2 notes CNS progression was diagnosed in 05/2023 (3 months prior to admission) and describes current CSF findings as a \\'minute population of abnormal B cells\\' indicating residual disease, not new progression. 3. No documentation of new CNS progression during the 08/2023 admission. Thus, the summary\\'s timeline contradicts the \\'recent\\' progression claim.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 18, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that \\'An admission acute kidney injury resolved with IV fluids, though mild hypokalemia persisted despite oral and IV repletion.\\' This indicates that the acute kidney injury was resolved, which is consistent with the Important Fact. However, it also mentions that \\'mild hypokalemia persisted,\\' which contradicts the Important Fact that \\'Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission.\\' The persistence of hypokalemia despite repletion indicates it did not resolve.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission.\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary explicitly states under Problem #3: \\'AKI resolved\\' (creatinine improved to baseline) but notes \\'mild hypokalemia persists despite repletion\\' with potassium levels remaining low (3.3 mmol/L) on 08/05 and 08/06. 3. Resolution of hypokalemia is directly contradicted by persistent hypokalemia documented in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 20, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** HHT with new PE/DVT s/p IVC filter placement as well as changed to fondaparinux\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The fact states \\'changed to fondaparinux\\', but the summary shows the opposite: patient was initially on fondaparinux and was changed FROM fondaparinux TO apixaban. 2. Specifically, summary states \\'Continued fondaparinux 2.5mg daily at SUH until 05/12/2023\\' and \\'Switched to apixaban 10mg BID (loading dose) on 05/13/2023\\'. 3. The IVC filter placement part is consistent (documented as placed on 05/10/2023 at OSH). 4. The direction of anticoagulation change is clearly contradictory between the fact and summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states anticoagulation was \\'changed to fondaparinux\\'. 2. Hospital Summary documents transition FROM fondaparinux TO apixaban (Problem #1: \\'Switched to apixaban 10mg BID on 05/13/2023\\' after being on fondaparinux at OSH and SUH). 3. These anticoagulation changes are mutually exclusive directions of therapy.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The Important Fact mentions \\'worsening thrombocytopenia\\' and \\'prednisone taper initiation\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary shows: Thrombocytopenia was initially worsening (platelets dropping from 72 to 64) Instead of initiating a prednisone taper, the dose was actually INCREASED from 40mg to 100mg daily This is directly opposite to a \\'taper initiation\\' 3. The increase in prednisone dose (rather than a taper) directly contradicts the Important Fact\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that the patient was admitted with \\'progressive thrombocytopenia\\' and was treated with prednisone. Initially, the patient was on prednisone 40mg daily started on 05/09/2023 at OSH, which is consistent with the fact that prednisone taper was initiated. However, instead of tapering, the dose was increased to 100mg daily on 05/13/2023, and the patient showed improvement in platelet counts. The fact mentions \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\', implying that thrombocytopenia worsened after starting prednisone taper. The summary indicates that thrombocytopenia improved after increasing the prednisone dose, contradicting the fact that thrombocytopenia worsened after prednisone taper initiation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The fact states \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation.\\' 2. The summary shows thrombocytopenia IMPROVED (platelets rose from 64 to 82) after PREDNISONE DOSE WAS INCREASED to 100mg daily (not tapered). 3. A prednisone \\'taper\\' implies dose reduction, but the summary documents a dose escalation. These are mutually exclusive scenarios.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary does not contradict the fact about recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup. 2. The summary acknowledges recurrent falls but provides clear etiological factors: T6 compression fracture identified Complex cardiac conditions (HFrEF, NSVT, atrial flutter) Dementia and confusion Mobility limitations documented by PT 3. The workup was thorough but targeted, including: CT head/spine/chest/abdomen/pelvis Cardiac monitoring Physical therapy evaluation 4. The falls were not described as \\'unknown etiology\\' in the summary, but rather appeared to have multiple contributing factors identified.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The hospital course summary describes the T6 compression fracture as \\'acute\\' and directly attributes it to the recent falls that prompted admission on 03/14/2023. 2. The CT findings are described as an \\'interval\\' anterior wedge compression deformity of T6, suggesting a new finding. 3. The summary consistently treats this as a new injury requiring acute pain management and rehabilitation. 4. This directly contradicts the Important Fact which states the T6 wedge compression fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall\\'.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the T6 wedge compression fracture likely happened before the most recent fall. The Hospital Course Summary states that the patient was admitted due to recurrent falls, which led to an acute T6 compression fracture. The summary directly links the T6 compression fracture to the recent falls, contradicting the Important Fact that suggests the fracture likely occurred before the most recent fall. Therefore, the Hospital Course Summary conflicts with the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the T6 fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall.\\' 2. The Hospital Summary describes the fracture as \\'acute T6 compression fracture\\' caused by \\'recurrent falls\\' leading to admission. 3. \\'Acute\\' implies the fracture was new/related to recent trauma (falls), conflicting with the pre existing nature suggested in the Important Fact. 4. The CT finding of \\'interval anterior wedge compression deformity\\' (Problem #1) supports a pre existing component, but the summary\\'s explicit attribution to recent falls creates contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 22, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'Post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary describes cholangitis but does not mention it being post procedural or following a recent stent exchange 3. The surgical history shows the most recent biliary procedure was IR drain revision on 12/25/2022, but not a stent exchange 4. The cholangitis appears to be related to biliary drain malfunction rather than a stent exchange procedure 5. While there was an ERCP with stent placement on 11/14/2022, this was not described as recent or causally related to the current cholangitis episode\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange.\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary documents cholangitis attributed to biliary drain malfunction (PTBD uncapping resolved symptoms) and lists ERCP stent placement (11/14/2022) and IR biliary drain placements/revisions (11/23/2022, 12/25/2022) in surgical history. 3. No mention of a biliary stent exchange procedure occurring between 12/25/2022 drain revision and 12/27/2022 admission. 4. Cholangitis etiology in the summary is explicitly linked to drain issues, not stent exchange. This creates a contradiction regarding the procedural cause.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary indicates the patient is on piperacillin tazobactam, while the fact mentions augmentin therapy 2. The summary states \\'Continue piperacillin tazobactam to complete course\\' without any mention of switching to or evaluating augmentin 3. No mention of a 14 day course or re evaluation of antibiotic therapy prior to completion 4. The antibiotics mentioned in the summary and the fact are different medications, making them factually inconsistent\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact to check is \\'should continue and re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\'. The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was treated with intravenous piperacillin tazobactam for E. coli bacteremia and cholangitis, not Augmentin. The summary under \\'Problem #1: Cholangitis and Biliary Drain Malfunction\\' states \\'Continue piperacillin tazobactam to complete course.\\' Since the patient was on piperacillin tazobactam and not Augmentin, the summary does not directly address the continuation of Augmentin therapy. Therefore, the Hospital Course Summary is inconsistent with the Important Fact because it refers to a different antibiotic.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'should continue and re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion.\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary documents that piperacillin tazobactam was initiated and planned for completion, with no mention of Augmentin. 3. These are distinct antibiotics; using piperacillin tazobactam instead of Augmentin directly contradicts the instruction to continue/re evaluate Augmentin.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 23, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** large pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary states a large right pleural effusion was present on admission (02/08) and thoracentesis (1.75L removed) was performed (02/09). 2. However, under Problem #2, the \\'Current Clinical Status\\' notes a \\'persistent moderate right pleural effusion\\' at discharge, and \\'Outstanding/Pending Issues\\' lists \\'persistent moderate loculated right pleural effusion.\\' 3. The fact \\'large pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis\\' implies resolution post procedure, but the summary explicitly documents unresolved effusion despite thoracentesis, creating a contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 24, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states discharge on \\'oral pain medications\\'. 2. Hospital summary\\'s discharge plan lists Zofran (ondansetron) and Reglan (metoclopramide), which are antiemetics/prokinetics, not pain medications. 3. IV acetaminophen was used during admission, but no transition to oral pain medications is documented in discharge instructions. 4. Summary explicitly details discharge medications but omits oral analgesics, directly conflicting with the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 25, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID.\\' Hospital Summary (Problem #4) specifies \\'transitioned to oral pantoprazole 40mg daily\\' (once daily, not BID). 2. Summary\\'s FL Upper GI (01/13/2024) aligns with Important Fact\\'s \\'no gastric outlet obstruction,\\' but PPI dosing discrepancy (BID vs. daily) creates direct conflict in management. 3. Both cannot be true simultaneously, indicating contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 25, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary does not explicitly mention AKI on admission. However, under Problem #1: Malignant Ascites / Abdominal Distention, it is mentioned that \\'furosemide 20mg daily and spironolactone 25mg daily (held temporarily during AKI)\\'. This indicates that AKI occurred during the hospital stay, but it was not present on admission as the medications were \\'held temporarily during AKI\\', implying the AKI happened after admission. Therefore, the statement \\'AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved\\' is inconsistent with the information provided in the Hospital Course Summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary acknowledges SMA stenosis in CT findings: \\'Moderate narrowing of the proximal superior mesenteric artery\\' 2. However, the summary explicitly states \\'no evidence of acute mesenteric ischemia\\' 3. The patient\\'s symptoms are attributed to gastroparesis/gastritis rather than mesenteric ischemia 4. The symptoms resolved with IV fluids and symptomatic treatment, not consistent with chronic mesenteric ischemia as the primary cause 5. The patient has documented gastroparesis as part of their medical history, which better explains the presenting symptoms\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the CT Abdomen Pelvis Angiography on 01/26/2023 showed \\'Moderate narrowing of the proximal superior mesenteric artery, no evidence of acute mesenteric ischemia.\\' The Important Fact states that the patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia due to SMA stenosis as revealed by CT angiography. The summary and the fact cannot both be true because the summary indicates that there was no evidence of acute mesenteric ischemia and does not directly link the SMA stenosis to the patient\\'s symptoms, thus not supporting the fact that emesis is related to chronic mesenteric ischemia.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia due to SMA stenosis. 2. The Hospital Summary\\'s CT angiography confirmed SMA stenosis but explicitly states \\'no evidence of acute mesenteric ischemia\\' and attributes GI symptoms to gastritis/dyspepsia/gastroparesis. 3. Chronic mesenteric ischemia (a distinct entity from acute) is not addressed as a potential cause in the summary, creating a contradiction with the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient was admitted for neutropenic fever and found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia, treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics. The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient was admitted with neutropenic fever and found to have Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (mecA+) bacteremia, attributed to his LUE PICC line, which was removed on 03/05/2023. The summary also states that the patient was treated with IV vancomycin and piperacillin tazobactam, and later transitioned to oral linezolid to complete therapy for bacteremia. The key differences are: 1) the organism identified (Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus vs coagulase negative strep), and 2) the PICC line was removed but there\\'s no explicit mention of its replacement in the summary. Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus and coagulase negative strep are different; however, the treatment and condition (bacteremia related to PICC line) are consistent. The absence of explicit PICC replacement in the summary is noted, but the plan includes assessing the need and arranging for new PICC line placement for ongoing chemotherapy.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states bacteremia was caused by \\'coagulase negative strep\\' (Streptococcus). 2. Hospital Summary (Problem #1) identifies the pathogen as \\'Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus\\' (Staphylococcus). 3. Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are distinct bacterial genera; they cannot both be the causative organism in this context. 4. This is a direct contradiction in pathogen identification.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 28, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The Important Fact states PTBD exchange occurred on 4/21/23 2. The Hospital Course Summary shows: Patient was admitted on 4/6/23 Had PTBD exchange on 4/8/23 Was discharged to hospice on 4/12/23 3. Since the patient was already discharged on 4/12/23, they could not have had a PTBD exchange on 4/21/23 during this admission 4. The dates clearly conflict, making the summary inconsistent with the stated fact\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient was admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23. The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient was admitted on 04/06/2023 for biliary obstruction, hyperbilirubinemia, and other issues, and underwent a PTBD exchange on 04/08/2023. The dates of admission and PTBD exchange in the summary (04/06/2023 and 04/08/2023, respectively) do not match the date mentioned in the Important Fact (4/21/23). This discrepancy indicates a clear conflict between the two.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states PTBD exchange occurred on 4/21/23. 2. Hospital Summary documents PTBD exchange on 04/08/2023. 3. These dates are mutually exclusive; the same procedure cannot occur on two different dates. 4. No mention of a second PTBD on 4/21/23 in the summary. Thus, clear contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states \\'subsequent gradual improvement in bilirubin levels\\' and shows bilirubin trending down from 16.8 mg/dL to 10.8 mg/dL after PTBD exchange. 2. This directly contradicts the Important Fact stating \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange.\\' 3. While both summaries agree on the transition to hospice care, they present opposite outcomes regarding bilirubin response to PTBD exchange. 4. The numerical lab values in the summary provide clear evidence of bilirubin improvement, making this contradiction explicit.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that after the PTBD exchange on 04/08/2023, there was \\'subsequent gradual improvement in bilirubin levels\\' and \\'Total Bilirubin trended down from 16.8 mg/dL (04/06) to 10.8 mg/dL (04/11)\\', which directly contradicts the Important Fact that \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange\\'.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states bilirubin did not improve post PTBD exchange. 2. Hospital Summary (Problem #1) documents serial labs showing total bilirubin decreased from 16.8 mg/dL (04/06) to 10.8 mg/dL (04/11) after PTBD exchange on 04/08. 3. Summary explicitly states \\'Hyperbilirubinemia improving but persistent\\' and \\'Current Clinical Status\\'. 4. These objective lab trends and clinical assessment directly contradict the claim that \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange\\'. 5. Transition to hospice is confirmed in both documents and not in conflict.\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The fact states sepsis required antibiotics and fluids. The summary mentions antibiotics (piperacillin tazobactam) for \\'presumed cholangitis\\' and IV fluids for dehydration/hypotension, but does not explicitly diagnose sepsis as a complication. 2. The fact lists urinary retention requiring a catheter. The summary documents Foley catheter placement for oliguria (low urine output) due to dehydration/renal factors, not retention. 3. Delirium management with pharmacotherapy (mirtazapine/melatonin) is consistent in both. The sepsis and urinary retention discrepancies are irreconcilable.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Presence of important facts\\n\\n**Score: 36/100** (95% CI: 26-46) (higher values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the important facts missing:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries frequently omit critical clinical facts due to recurring patterns: (1) **Incomplete procedural documentation** (e.g., Patient 0’s JP drain, Patient 1’s chest tube), where device placement or removal is excluded despite related surgeries; (2) **Missing specificity** in labs/medications (e.g., Patient 0’s hemoglobin 8.8, Patient 6’s Synthroid initiation, Patient 20’s apixaban dose); (3) **Failure to link diagnoses** (e.g., Patient 4’s AKI not tied to urinary retention, Patient 26’s SMA stenosis unrelated to emesis); (4) **Ambiguous timelines**, such as planned vs. completed interventions (Patient 2’s bowel resection, Patient 7’s neoadjuvant chemo); (5) **Vague discharge instructions** (Patient 12’s TPN follow-up frequency, Patient 22’s antibiotic duration); (6) **Incomplete problem lists** (Patient 13’s borderline personality disorder, Patient 10’s cirrhosis); and (7) **Unreported test results** (Patient 27’s TTE, Patient 19’s ESBL organisms). Assumed diagnoses without explicit documentation (Patient 17’s delirium tremens, Patient 23’s pleural effusion) and omitted causal relationships (Patient 28’s hospice decision rationale) further illustrate systemic gaps in capturing clinical context and rationale.\\n\\n### B. Hospital course summaries contradicting important facts\\n\\n**Score: 16/100** (95% CI: 8-24) (lower values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the inconsistencies:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries frequently exhibit inconsistencies with clinical facts due to recurring patterns: **procedural/temporal discrepancies** (e.g., Patient 2’s small bowel resection described as both completed and planned; Patient 29’s cancer management noted as deferred in facts but actively planned in summaries), **contradictory clinical statuses** (Patient 2’s NPO status and vomiting vs. documented bowel movements; Patient 13’s “unremarkable” postoperative course vs. pain drips and glycemic instability), **medication/dosage mismatches** (Patient 6’s insulin transition from Lantus in the summary vs. to Lantus in the fact; Patient 9’s Zosyn vs. ciprofloxacin antibiotic regimens), **diagnostic misinterpretations** (Patient 21’s “new” vs. pre-existing T6 fracture; Patient 27’s coagulase-negative *Strep* vs. *Staph* bacteremia), and **omission of key complications** (Patient 28’s undocumented sepsis, delirium, and urinary retention). Additionally, **lab-clinical discordance** arises when documented findings (e.g., Patient 4’s “stable” renal function vs. AKI diagnosis; Patient 20’s improving platelets vs. “worsening thrombocytopenia”) or **misattributed etiologies** (Patient 15’s viral gastroenteritis diagnosis vs. medication-induced symptoms) create irreconcilable contradictions. These patterns reflect documentation errors, inconsistent terminology, and failure to reconcile evolving plans with final outcomes.\\n\\n## Detailed results\\n\\n### A.

All Missing Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 0, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left-sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of a left sided abdominal JP (Jackson Pratt) drain or any drain being present at discharge. While the summary discusses a Whipple procedure and post operative care, it does not specify any details about surgical drains. The discharge planning and outstanding issues sections, where drain management would typically be mentioned, do not include any information about drains. The only post operative details mentioned relate to pain management, diet advancement, ambulation, and general monitoring for complications.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if the fact \\'Left sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary details the patient\\'s hospital course under various problem headings and outlines the discharge plan and outstanding issues. However, upon reviewing the provided text, there is no mention of a JP drain or any specific details regarding its presence or removal. The summary discusses the patient\\'s recovery post Whipple procedure, current status, and plans for discharge, but does not include information about a JP drain.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed all sections of the hospital course summary for mentions of drains or postoperative devices. 2. Checked \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' under Problem #1 (Whipple procedure) no mention of drain placement. 3. Scanned \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' and \\'Outstanding/Pending Issues\\' across both problems no reference to JP drains or abdominal drainage devices. 4. Verified \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section specifically mentions arranging a walker but no drainage devices. 5. Confirmed that while postoperative care is addressed, the explicit fact about a left sided abdominal JP drain being left at discharge is absent in all documented elements.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 0, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Discharged with DVT prophylaxis, with anemia at hemoglobin 8.8\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After analyzing the hospital course summary step by step: 1. Regarding DVT prophylaxis: There is no explicit mention of DVT prophylaxis being prescribed at discharge in the summary. While this would be standard practice after a Whipple procedure, we cannot assume it was given without explicit documentation. 2. Regarding anemia with Hgb 8.8: While \\'microcytic anemia\\' is mentioned in the Relevant Medical History section, there is no specific hemoglobin value of 8.8 mentioned anywhere in the text. 3. The summary does mention anemia but lacks the specific details (Hgb 8.8) that are part of the fact we\\'re looking for. 4. The discharge plan and outstanding issues sections do not mention either DVT prophylaxis or specific anemia parameters. Therefore, while anemia is mentioned in general terms, the specific fact we\\'re looking for (DVT prophylaxis AND Hgb 8.8) is not explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact \\'Discharged with DVT prophylaxis, with anemia at hemoglobin 8.8\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary, we need to analyze the provided summary step by step. First, we look for any mention of \\'DVT prophylaxis.\\' The discharge plan and goals include \\'early ambulation,\\' which can be related to DVT prophylaxis as it is a common method to prevent DVT. However, there is no explicit mention of \\'DVT prophylaxis.\\' Next, we search for information regarding \\'anemia at hemoglobin 8.8.\\' The summary mentions \\'microcytic anemia\\' under \\'Relevant Medical History,\\' indicating the patient has anemia, but it does not provide a specific hemoglobin level of 8.8. Since neither \\'DVT prophylaxis\\' nor \\'hemoglobin 8.8\\' is explicitly mentioned, we conclude that the specific fact is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Checking for DVT prophylaxis: The discharge plan mentions \\'early ambulation\\' but does not explicitly state pharmacological DVT prophylaxis (e.g., anticoagulants like heparin/enoxaparin) or mechanical methods. While ambulation is a preventive measure, it is not equivalent to formal DVT prophylaxis documentation. 2. Checking for anemia at hemoglobin 8.8: The \\'Relevant Medical History\\' includes \\'microcytic anemia,\\' but no hemoglobin value (e.g., 8.8) is documented in the summary. The discharge plan does not mention anemia management or hemoglobin levels. Conclusion: Neither component of the fact (specific DVT prophylaxis or hemoglobin 8.8) is explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 1, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypoxia 2/2 recurrent R pleura effusion\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary: 1. I searched for explicit mentions of hypoxia or breathing difficulties 2. I looked for mentions of pleural effusion, particularly right sided 3. I examined all problem listings and complications 4. I checked the \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section 5. No mention of respiratory issues, hypoxia, or pleural effusion was found anywhere in the text 6. The summary focuses primarily on SBO and cholangiocarcinoma management 7. While other complications and issues are listed in detail, there is no reference to breathing problems or chest fluid collections\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact \\'Hypoxia 2/2 recurrent R pleura effusion\\' is mentioned in the hospital course summary, I will analyze the provided text step by step. First, I will look for keywords related to \\'Hypoxia\\', \\'pleura effusion\\', and \\'R\\' or \\'right\\'. Upon reviewing the summary, I notice that it is organized by problems and includes relevant medical and surgical history, as well as outstanding issues. I will check each section for any mention of the keywords. The summary discusses Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO) and Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma but does not directly mention \\'Hypoxia\\' or \\'pleura effusion\\'. I will continue to scan through the Relevant Medical History, Relevant Surgical History, and Outstanding Issues/Follow Up sections. None of these sections contain the terms \\'Hypoxia\\' or \\'pleura effusion\\'. Therefore, based on the absence of these keywords or their synonyms in the summary, I conclude that the fact \\'Hypoxia 2/2 recurrent R pleura effusion\\' is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed Problem #1 (SBO) and Problem #2 (Cholangiocarcinoma) sections: No mention of hypoxia, pleural effusion, or respiratory issues. 2. Scanned \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\' for imaging findings related to pleural effusion (e.g., chest imaging, oxygen saturation reports): None present. 3. Checked \\'Therapeutic Procedures\\' for interventions targeting hypoxia or pleural effusion (e.g., oxygen therapy, thoracentesis): Absent. 4. Examined \\'Current Clinical Status\\' and \\'Discharge Plan\\' sections: No references to respiratory status or pleural effusion management. 5. Verified \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\': No plans for pleural effusion monitoring or hypoxia management. The summary focuses entirely on gastrointestinal and oncologic issues without any respiratory complications documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 1, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** R chest tube was placed with drainage; intrapleural alteplase given; chest tube removed\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I find no mention of a right chest tube placement, drainage, intrapleural alteplase administration, or chest tube removal. The summary focuses primarily on two main problems: Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO) and Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma. The document details diagnostic procedures (CT scans), therapeutic interventions (NGT placement, IVF), and surgical history, but contains no information about chest tube placement or management. The surgical history section lists several procedures but does not include any chest tube interventions. The outstanding issues and follow up section also does not mention any chest related procedures or complications.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary is analyzed by reviewing each section for any mention of a right chest tube placement, drainage, administration of intrapleural alteplase, and subsequent removal of the chest tube. The summary is divided into sections based on problems, relevant medical history, surgical history, and outstanding issues. Upon reviewing \\'Problem #1: Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO)\\' and \\'Problem #2: Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma\\', there is no mention of chest tube placement or intrapleural alteplase administration. The \\'Relevant Medical History\\' and \\'Relevant Surgical History\\' sections also do not mention any procedures related to chest tube placement. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists several follow up tasks but does not include any related to chest tube care or complications. Therefore, the specific fact about the R chest tube being placed with drainage, intrapleural alteplase given, and the chest tube removed is not mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary is analyzed in sections. Problem #1 (SBO) mentions NG tube decompression but no chest tube. Problem #2 (Cholangiocarcinoma) has no procedural interventions. Surgical history includes EGD, ERCP, and other surgeries but no chest tube placement. The therapeutic procedures, medical history, and follow up plans do not reference chest tube placement, intrapleural alteplase administration, or chest tube removal. The fact\\'s components (R chest tube, drainage, alteplase, removal) are entirely absent from all sections of the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 1, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** TSH suggested hypothyroidism; synthroid was started\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no mention of TSH levels, hypothyroidism, or the initiation of synthroid (levothyroxine) treatment. The summary covers multiple medical problems, including Small Bowel Obstruction and Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma, and includes detailed information about diagnostic investigations, procedures, and follow up plans. Lab abnormalities are mentioned only in general terms (\\'no significant lab abnormalities related to cancer\\' and monitoring of \\'CBC, LFTs, and electrolytes\\'), but there is no specific reference to thyroid function tests or thyroid medication management.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary is analyzed for the mention of \\'TSH suggested hypothyroidism; synthroid was started\\'. The summary is structured around specific problems and includes sections on key diagnostic investigations, therapeutic procedures, current clinical status, and discharge plans. It covers issues related to Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO) and Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma. The summary also includes relevant medical and surgical history, outstanding issues, and follow up plans. However, there is no mention of TSH levels, hypothyroidism, or the initiation of synthroid in any part of the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed section by section. Problem #1 (SBO) and Problem #2 (Cholangiocarcinoma) focus on bowel obstruction management and cancer follow up, respectively. The \\'Relevant Medical History\\' and \\'Surgical History\\' sections do not mention thyroid disorders or Synthroid. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' lists labs including CBC, LFTs, and electrolytes but does not include TSH. No part of the summary references hypothyroidism, TSH levels, or the initiation of Synthroid therapy. The absence of these terms or clear clinical synonyms (e.g., levothyroxine) confirms the fact is not mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 2, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed. Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary in detail, I do not find any explicit mention of adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall being taken down, or the removal of obstructing necrotic mass with small bowel resection and primary anastomosis. While the summary does mention: 1. The presence of a necrotic small bowel mass (in Problem #1) 2. Plans for a \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection (possible open)\\' 3. \\'Awaiting surgical decision\\' However, the actual performance of the surgery and its specific details (taking down adhesions, removing necrotic mass, performing primary anastomosis) are not explicitly documented in this summary. The text suggests the surgery is planned but has not yet occurred, as evidenced by phrases like \\'planned\\' and \\'awaiting surgical decision.\\'\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s diagnosis, treatment, and management plan for various medical conditions. To determine if the specific fact \\'Adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed. Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\' is mentioned, we need to examine the summary closely. The summary lists multiple problems and their corresponding diagnostic investigations, therapeutic procedures, and current clinical status. Under Problem #1: Metastatic Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma with Small Bowel Necrotic Mass, it is mentioned that a \\'General surgery consultation for small bowel mass; laparoscopic small bowel resection (possible open) planned.\\' However, it does not explicitly state that the adhesions were taken down, necrotic mass removed, or that a small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed. It only indicates that such a procedure was planned. Therefore, the specific fact is not explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states under Problem #1\\'s Therapeutic Procedures: \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection (possible open) planned\\' and mentions a \\'surgical oncology consultation for potential resection\\' in the Discharge Plan. However, there is no explicit mention of adhesions between the omentum and abdominal wall being taken down, nor is there confirmation that the obstructing necrotic mass was removed or that a small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed. The procedures described are framed as planned or pending decisions, not as completed actions. The terms \\'adhesions,\\' \\'necrotic mass removal,\\' or \\'primary anastomosis\\' do not appear in any form (verbatim, abbreviated, or synonymous) in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 2, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient recovered from surgery well; had flatus and bowel movement \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary in detail, there is no explicit mention of the patient having flatus or bowel movement post surgery. While there are several sections discussing GI status (Problem #11) and Diet/MIVF (Problem #13), they only mention: 1. Patient tolerating PS1 diet 2. Having bowel regimen with senna and miralax 3. No bowel obstruction 4. Mild abdominal tenderness Nowhere in the text does it specifically state that the patient had flatus or a bowel movement, which would be important post surgical markers of bowel function recovery.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s status across various problems. Under Problem #11: Gastrointestinal (GI) Status, it is mentioned that the patient is \\'tolerating PS1 diet\\' and under Problem #13: Diet/MIVF, it is stated that the patient is \\'NPO, receiving IV fluids, tolerating PS1 diet.\\' Additionally, under Problem #1: Metastatic Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma with Small Bowel Necrotic Mass, the patient is reported to have \\'no signs of bowel obstruction.\\' However, the specific fact \\'Patient recovered from surgery well; had flatus and bowel movement\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the summary. The closest relevant information is under \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' in Problem #11, where \\'Bowel reg with senna, miralax\\' is mentioned, indicating an attempt to manage bowel movements, but there is no direct statement about the patient having flatus or a bowel movement after surgery.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) Reviewed all 14 problem sections in the hospital course summary. 2) Focused on surgical recovery in Problem #1 (sarcoma) and GI status in Problem #11. 3) Found that while bowel regimen medications (senna, miralax) are mentioned under therapeutic procedures for GI status, there is no explicit documentation of flatus or bowel movement occurrence. 4) The summary states \\'no bowel obstruction\\' and \\'tolerating PS1 diet\\' but these indicate functional capacity rather than actual bowel function recovery. 5) The planned small bowel resection is noted as \\'planned\\' rather than completed, making surgical recovery status inapplicable. 6) No sections mention post operative recovery milestones or specific bowel function restoration. Conclusion: The fact isn\\'t explicitly stated in any form (including equivalents like \\'passing gas\\' or \\'BM documented\\').\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 3, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** LLQ abdominal pain 2/2 cancer\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary mentions \\'recurrent lower quadrant abdominal pain\\' in both the presentation and key issues. 2. The pain is described as \\'possibly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) like symptoms\\' but is not explicitly attributed to cancer (2/2 cancer). 3. While the patient has stage IV sigmoid adenocarcinoma with metastases, the summary does not directly state a causal relationship between the LLQ pain and malignancy. 4. Attribution to IBS like symptoms rather than cancer related etiology means the specific fact of \\'abdominal pain 2/2 cancer\\' is not explicitly documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 4, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step: 1. The text mentions the patient has CKD IV (chronic kidney disease stage IV) in their history 2. The summary discusses urinary retention as a primary issue, attributed to BPH 3. The text mentions treatment with Foley catheter placement for the urinary retention 4. However, while both CKD and urinary retention are present, the text does not explicitly state that the patient developed AKI (acute kidney injury) on top of their CKD 5. The text actually notes that blood tests indicated \\'stable kidney function\\' 6. Therefore, while the urinary retention and its treatment with Foley catheter are mentioned, and CKD is present, there is no mention of AKI developing as a result of the urinary retention\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact \\'AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary, we need to analyze the provided text step by step. First, we look for mentions of \\'AKI\\' (Acute Kidney Injury), \\'CKD\\' (Chronic Kidney Disease), \\'urinary retention\\', and \\'Foley catheter placement\\'. The summary mentions that the patient has \\'CKD IV\\' (Chronic Kidney Disease stage IV) under their medical history. It also states that the patient was admitted for \\'urinary retention secondary to an enlarged prostate\\', and that \\'Foley catheter placement\\' was performed as a therapeutic procedure for this condition. However, there is no explicit mention of \\'AKI\\' or \\'AKI on CKD\\'. The summary does mention that \\'Blood tests indicated stable kidney function\\', which implies that there was no significant acute deterioration in kidney function during the hospital stay. Therefore, while \\'CKD\\', \\'urinary retention\\', and \\'Foley catheter placement\\' are mentioned, \\'AKI on CKD\\' is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly states the patient has chronic kidney disease stage IV (CKD IV). 2. Urinary retention secondary to BPH is documented as the reason for admission and Foley catheter placement. 3. However, the summary specifies \\'blood tests indicated stable kidney function\\' with no mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening renal function. The phrase \\'AKI on CKD\\' implies an acute deterioration superimposed on chronic disease, which is not described here. 4. While urinary retention and Foley placement are clearly noted, the absence of any reference to acute kidney injury (verbatim, via lab trends, or clinical documentation) means the full fact \\'AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention\\' is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 5, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Increased bloody output from JP drain observed on POD1, gradually improved\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of increased bloody output from JP drain specifically on POD1, nor any mention of gradual improvement from a bloody state. While the summary does mention drain output several times (\\'thinning but ongoing drain output\\', \\'improving drain output\\', and multiple mentions of monitoring drain output), it does not specify the characteristics of the output being bloody or indicate any temporal progression starting from POD1. The descriptions are general and do not provide the specific detail about bloody output or its temporal course that we\\'re looking for.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'thinning but ongoing drain output\\' under \\'Current Clinical Status\\' for Problem #1 and \\'Stable with improving drain output\\' under \\'Current Clinical Status\\' for Problem #2. These statements indicate that the drain output was initially significant but improved over time. Although the summary does not explicitly state \\'increased bloody output from JP drain observed on POD1\\', the mention of \\'improving drain output\\' implies that there was a notable drain output that was decreasing. The absence of the specific term \\'bloody\\' or \\'JP drain\\' does not negate the implication of significant initial output that improved. Thus, the fact is implicitly supported by the mention of improving drain output.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'thinning but ongoing drain output\\' under Problem #1 and \\'improving drain output\\' under Problem #2. However, there is no explicit mention of \\'increased bloody output from JP drain observed on POD1\\' or equivalent phrasing. While \\'improving\\' suggests gradual resolution, the text does not state there was an initial increase in output specifically on postoperative day 1 (POD1), nor does it describe the drain output as \\'bloody\\'. The absence of these specific temporal and qualitative details means the fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'Adrenal Insufficiency, Adrenal Crisis\\' as Problem #1. It details the patient\\'s undetectable cortisol levels, elevated ACTH, and treatment with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone, indicating adrenal insufficiency. The summary also mentions \\'Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2 (APS)\\' in the patient\\'s relevant medical history, which includes adrenal insufficiency among other conditions. However, it does not directly state that the adrenal crisis was due to intolerance of PO prednisone. The summary does mention the administration of hydrocortisone and transition to other medications but does not specify that PO prednisone was attempted or not tolerated. Thus, while the summary implies that the patient has primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune polyglandular syndrome and experienced an adrenal crisis, it does not explicitly mention that the crisis was likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'Adrenal Insufficiency, Adrenal Crisis\\' and \\'Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2 (APS)\\' in the problem list and medical history. However, the summary does not mention prednisone (PO or otherwise) or any intolerance to oral glucocorticoids. The treatment described uses hydrocortisone (IV/subcutaneous/oral) and fludrocortisone, with no reference to prednisone. While the adrenal crisis and its association with APS are clearly stated, the specific claim of prednisone intolerance as a cause is absent. A physician reviewing this summary would not find evidence of prednisone use or intolerance documented here.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, while Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is mentioned multiple times and insulin therapy changes are discussed, the specific fact about changing to lantus 15 units twice a day is not explicitly stated. The summary mentions a \\'transition from insulin glargine to subcutaneous insulin lispro\\' (which is actually the opposite of changing TO lantus, since insulin glargine is Lantus). The summary indicates insulin adjustments were made but does not specify the exact dosing of 15 units twice daily. Under Problem #2, it discusses insulin therapy and mentions titration of doses, but the specific regimen mentioned in the fact is not present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM)\\' under Problem #2. It states that the patient was on \\'insulin therapy\\' and that there was a \\'transition from insulin glargine to subcutaneous insulin lispro.\\' The fact we are looking for is \\'Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\' The summary does mention Type 1 diabetes and a change in insulin regimen, but it specifies a transition from \\'insulin glargine\\' (which is Lantus) to \\'insulin lispro,\\' not to Lantus. Insulin glargine and Lantus are the same, so the initial insulin was Lantus, but it was changed to insulin lispro, not to Lantus. Additionally, the dosage \\'15units twice a day\\' is not mentioned. Therefore, the exact fact is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary for Problem #2 (Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus) states that the patient was transitioned from insulin glargine to subcutaneous insulin lispro. Lantus is a brand name for insulin glargine, but the summary explicitly mentions a transition away from glargine (Lantus) to lispro, not an adjustment to Lantus dosing. The specific dose of \\'15 units twice daily\\' is also not mentioned. While insulin therapy is discussed broadly, the exact fact about changing to Lantus 15 units BID is not stated in any form (verbatim, synonym, or abbreviation).\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 6, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Vitamin D deficiency, started on replacement, fat soluble vitamins sent, need to follow-up \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary systematically for mentions of vitamin D deficiency and related treatment: 1. Searched for direct mentions of \\'vitamin D\\' none found 2. Looked for \\'fat soluble vitamins\\' none found 3. Found two relevant but non specific references: Under Problem #1: \\'Follow up on malabsorption workup, vitamin deficiencies\\' In Outstanding Issues: \\'Address nutritional needs and potential malnutrition\\' 4. While vitamin deficiencies are mentioned generally, the specific elements we\\'re looking for (Vitamin D deficiency, replacement therapy, fat soluble vitamin testing, and related follow up) are not explicitly stated. The mentions are too general to count as explicitly including this fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'vitamin deficiencies\\' under the \\'Outstanding/Pending Issues\\' section for multiple problems and in the \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section. It specifically states \\'Follow up on malabsorption workup, vitamin deficiencies, and endocrinology consultation.\\' Although it does not explicitly state \\'Vitamin D deficiency\\' or \\'started on replacement,\\' it implies that vitamin deficiencies are a concern and need follow up. However, the specific fact \\'Vitamin D deficiency, started on replacement, fat soluble vitamins sent, need to follow up\\' is not explicitly mentioned in its entirety. The summary does mention that fat soluble vitamins are not explicitly referenced, but it does imply a need to follow up on vitamin deficiencies. The phrase \\'fat soluble vitamins sent\\' is not present, and \\'Vitamin D deficiency\\' and \\'started on replacement\\' are also not explicitly stated. Therefore, while related information is present, the exact fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'vitamin deficiencies\\' under Outstanding/Pending Issues and in the Follow Up section, but does not explicitly specify Vitamin D deficiency. While it states the need to follow up on vitamin deficiencies and address nutritional needs, there is no mention of Vitamin D replacement being started, fat soluble vitamins being sent, or specific follow up for Vitamin D. The general term \\'vitamin deficiencies\\' could encompass multiple possibilities, and the required components of the fact (specific deficiency, replacement initiation, fat soluble vitamins, and follow up) are not individually addressed.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 7, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left renal cell carcinoma status-post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post-op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The hospital course summary partially mentions the fact but does not explicitly indicate neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Let\\'s break down what is mentioned: 1. Left renal cell carcinoma is confirmed (Problem #1 mentions \\'Renal Cell Carcinoma\\') 2. IVC thrombus is confirmed (mentioned as \\'IVC thrombus\\' in Problem #1) 3. Left nephrectomy is confirmed (Problem #1 mentions \\'Left nephrectomy\\') 4. IVC thrombectomy is confirmed (mentioned as \\'tumor thrombectomy\\' in Problem #1) However, there is no mention anywhere in the summary of neoadjuvant chemotherapy being administered prior to surgery. This is a significant omission, as neoadjuvant therapy would typically be noted in the treatment history if it had occurred. Therefore, while most elements of the fact are present, the complete fact as stated is not fully documented in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'Renal Cell Carcinoma with IVC Thrombus\\' under Problem #1. It details a 12.7 cm left renal mass with IVC thrombus diagnosed via abdominal US and CT CAP. The patient underwent \\'Left nephrectomy with tumor thrombectomy,\\' which corresponds to the fact of being post op left nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy. Although the summary does not explicitly mention \\'neoadjuvant chemotherapy,\\' it does not negate the presence of the other key elements: left renal cell carcinoma, post op left nephrectomy, and IVC thrombectomy. The presence of these key elements in the summary indicates that the important fact is largely mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'Left nephrectomy with tumor thrombectomy\\' under Therapeutic Procedures Performed for Problem #1 (Renal Cell Carcinoma with IVC Thrombus), confirming the post op left nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy components. The diagnosis of left renal cell carcinoma is also clearly stated in the problem title and diagnostic findings. However, there is no mention of neoadjuvant chemotherapy anywhere in the summary. While the surgical components and diagnosis are documented, the absence of any reference to chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or otherwise) means the full fact as stated is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 7, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second-line\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no mention of: 1. Any immunotherapy treatment with ipilimumab/nivolumab (ipi/nivo) 2. Any hypersensitivity reaction to these medications 3. Any switch to cabozantinib as second line therapy The only cancer related information in the summary pertains to the renal cell carcinoma diagnosis and surgical management through left nephrectomy with tumor thrombectomy. The summary details various medical problems (#1 6) and their management, but contains no information about systemic cancer therapy or medication reactions. While Problem #1 discusses the renal cell carcinoma, it focuses solely on the surgical intervention and immediate post operative care.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary is analyzed for the presence of the fact \\'Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second line\\'. The summary is structured around several problems, including Renal Cell Carcinoma with IVC Thrombus, Hypertension, Prediabetes, Anxiety, Obstructive Sleep Apnea, and History of Coronary Artery Disease. None of these sections or the relevant medical history and outstanding issues mention \\'Hypersensitivity reaction\\', \\'ipi/nivo\\', or \\'cabozantinib\\'. The summary does not explicitly or implicitly refer to the specific fact regarding a hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo or switching to cabozantinib. Therefore, the fact is not mentioned in the hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed in detail. The key steps were: 1) Reviewing all 6 problem lists for mentions of immunotherapy (ipi/nivo) or cabozantinib. 2) Checking therapeutic procedures and discharge plans for treatment changes. 3) Examining \\'Relevant Medical History\\' and \\'Outstanding Issues\\' sections. No mention was found of immunotherapy agents (ipilimumab/nivolumab), hypersensitivity reactions, or cabozantinib use. The renal cell carcinoma management focused on surgical intervention without reference to systemic therapies. The discharge medications listed (apixaban, antihypertensives, metformin, paroxetine) don\\'t include cabozantinib. While the summary might be incomplete, the specific fact about immunotherapy hypersensitivity and treatment switch is absent from any section of the document.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 8, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Down\\'s syndrome, neurogenic bladder, admitted for pneumonia, treated with CAP regimen and vancomycin due to positive sputum culture for MRSA\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Down\\'s syndrome is explicitly mentioned in both the presentation and relevant medical history. 2. Neurogenic bladder is listed in the relevant medical history. 3. Admission for pneumonia is clearly stated with supporting CXR findings. 4. Vancomycin use is documented, and the CAP regimen components (Azithromycin + CTX [Ceftriaxone]) align with standard CAP treatment. However, while a sputum culture positive for Staph aureus is noted, MRSA is not explicitly identified in the culture results. The pending MRSA nares PCR suggests it was suspected but not confirmed. Since the fact requires MRSA positive sputum as the reason for vancomycin, this critical component is missing. Thus, the full fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of: 1) an aspiration event prior to discharge, 2) blood cultures with 1/4 bottles positive for GPC (Gram positive cocci), or 3) incomplete speciation at discharge. While the summary does mention blood cultures as pending (\\'Complete pending lab results, including blood culture\\'), it does not specify any results or positivity. The only culture result mentioned is a sputum culture positive for Staph aureus. The summary discusses the patient\\'s dysphagia with G tube, which might suggest aspiration risk, but no actual aspiration event is documented. Therefore, none of the specific elements of the fact we\\'re looking for are present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task requires determining whether the fact \\'Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. To do this, I will analyze the summary step by step. First, I will look for any mention of \\'aspiration event,\\' \\'GPC (Gram Positive Cocci),\\' or related terms like \\'blood culture\\' that could be associated with the fact in question. Upon reviewing the \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results,\\' \\'Outstanding/Pending Issues,\\' and other relevant sections, I found a mention of \\'blood culture\\' under \\'Outstanding/Pending Issues.\\' However, the specific details about the \\'1/4 bottles positive for GPC\\' are not provided. The summary does not explicitly mention \\'aspiration event\\' or \\'GPC.\\' Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed the \\'Hospital Course Summary\\' section: No mention of any aspiration event occurring prior to discharge. The patient\\'s dysphagia with G tube is noted in medical history, but no acute aspiration event is described. 2. Checked microbiology results: Sputum culture is reported as positive for Staph aureus (a GPC organism), but there is no reference to \\'1/4 bottles\\' or incomplete speciation at discharge. The summary specifically states \\'sputum culture positive for Staph aureus\\' (completed identification) and mentions pending blood culture/MRSA PCR, but these are different specimens. 3. Analyzed discharge documentation: No documentation of pending speciation for any cultures at discharge. The identified organism (Staph aureus) already represents completed speciation. 4. Conclusion: While GPC organisms are present (Staph aureus), the specific details about 1/4 bottles positive for GPC with pending speciation at discharge, and any explicit mention of a potential aspiration event prior to discharge, are absent from the document.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 8, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Neurogenic bladder, high risk of UTI\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact about neurogenic bladder and high risk of UTI is partially but explicitly mentioned in the text. The hospital course summary clearly states \\'neurogenic bladder\\' multiple times, including in both the opening paragraph and in the \\'Relevant Medical History\\' section. However, while neurogenic bladder is well known to increase UTI risk in medical practice, the summary does not explicitly state that the patient is at high risk for UTIs. Since we need both components to be explicitly mentioned to mark this as fully present, and only one component (neurogenic bladder) is explicitly stated, we cannot mark this as completely present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Neurogenic bladder, high risk of UTI\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. The summary lists \\'Neurogenic bladder and bowel\\' under \\'Relevant Medical History\\', which confirms the presence of neurogenic bladder. However, the summary does not explicitly state \\'high risk of UTI\\'. It is known that neurogenic bladder can increase the risk of UTI due to potential urinary stasis and catheter use, but the summary does not directly mention this risk. Therefore, while \\'neurogenic bladder\\' is mentioned, \\'high risk of UTI\\' is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly lists \\'neurogenic bladder\\' under both the \\'Relevant Medical History\\' section and in the patient\\'s presenting conditions. 2. The summary does not contain any explicit mention of \\'high risk of UTI\\' or equivalent phrasing (e.g., urinary tract infection risk, predisposition to UTIs). While neurogenic bladder is a known risk factor for UTIs, the text does not state this association or explicitly identify UTI risk as a clinical concern. 3. The combination of \\'neurogenic bladder\\' and \\'high risk of UTI\\' as a unified fact is not fully present, as only the first component is explicitly documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the key components: 1. Sepsis/UTI source: The summary mentions \\'Complicated Urinary Tract Infection with possible developing pyelonephritis\\' and confirms Klebsiella UTI. 2. 7 day Cipro course: This specific detail is NOT mentioned. The summary indicates the patient is on Zosyn with plans to \\'await sensitivities and de escalate antibiotics\\' but does not mention Cipro or a 7 day course. 3. Finasteride: The summary explicitly mentions starting finasteride multiple times, particularly in Problem #4, but it\\'s indicated for prostatomegaly rather than specifically for UTI prevention. 4. While the summary does document a urinary source infection with potential pyelonephritis and the use of finasteride, it differs in the specific antibiotic (Zosyn vs. Cipro) and duration details. The exact 7 day Cipro course is not mentioned, and the finasteride indication is described differently.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s diagnosis and treatment. The patient was diagnosed with a Complicated Urinary Tract Infection with possible developing pyelonephritis, confirmed by CT Abdomen/Pelvis and urine culture showing Klebsiella UTI >100K CFU/ml. The patient was initially administered Zosyn, and finasteride was started for prostatomegaly. The summary does not explicitly mention sepsis, but it does describe a complicated UTI with possible pyelonephritis, which aligns with the concept of sepsis from a urinary source. The patient was not explicitly stated to be on cipro upon discharge; instead, they were to continue Zosyn pending sensitivities. Finasteride was started during the hospital stay to address prostatomegaly, with the goal of potentially preventing future UTIs. Thus, while the summary does not mention \\'sepsis\\' directly or the patient finishing a \\'7 day course of cipro,\\' it does capture the essential elements of a urinary source infection, potential pyelonephritis, and the initiation of finasteride.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis from urinary source: The discharge plan in Problem #3 states \\'Correlate clinically once sepsis from UTI resolves,\\' confirming sepsis originating from a urinary source. 2. Potential pyelonephritis: Problem #1 is explicitly labeled \\'Complicated Urinary Tract Infection with possible developing pyelonephritis,\\' indicating potential pyelonephritis. 3. 7 day course of cipro: The summary mentions Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam) administration and plans to de escalate antibiotics, but no reference to ciprofloxacin or a 7 day antibiotic course at discharge exists. 4. Finasteride for UTI prevention: Finasteride was started for prostatomegaly (Problem #4), with no mention of UTI prevention as the rationale. Conclusion: While sepsis from a urinary source and potential pyelonephritis are confirmed, the absence of ciprofloxacin use and the different stated purpose for finasteride mean the full fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 9, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling, DVT US negative, unclear etiology \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I searched through the hospital course summary systematically, looking for any mention of extremity swelling or DVT ultrasound results. After reviewing: 1. All problem listings (#1 4) 2. The relevant medical history section 3. The outstanding issues/follow up section 4. The entire hospital course I found no mention of: Right upper extremity swelling Left lower extremity swelling DVT ultrasound being performed or its results Any unexplained swelling of any kind While the summary is quite detailed about other medical issues (UTI, diabetes, NPH, prostatomegaly), it contains no information about extremity swelling or DVT workup.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary is analyzed by reviewing each problem listed and the relevant medical history, surgical history, and outstanding issues. The specific fact to look for is \\'Right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling, DVT US negative, unclear etiology\\'. Upon reviewing the summary, none of the listed problems or sections directly mention swelling in the right upper extremity and left lower extremity, nor do they mention a negative DVT ultrasound or unclear etiology for such swelling. The summary covers various medical issues including a complicated UTI, diabetes management, possible normal pressure hydrocephalus, and prostatomegaly, but does not address the specified fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds through each problem and section of the hospital course summary. The key fact to identify is \\'Right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling, DVT US negative, unclear etiology.\\' A thorough review of all four clinical problems (UTI, diabetes, hydrocephalus, prostatomegaly), medical history, surgical history, and outstanding issues reveals no mention of extremity swelling, DVT imaging results, or an unclear etiology for such findings. The summary focuses on urinary, metabolic, neurological, and urological issues without any reference to vascular or limb related abnormalities. No clinical synonyms, abbreviations, or paraphrased descriptions matching the fact are present in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 10, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** The patient also was found to have cirrhosis of the liver but has compensated disease \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I find no explicit mention of liver cirrhosis or compensated liver disease. While there are some related findings that might suggest liver issues (such as \\'mild liver enzyme elevations\\' and \\'thrombocytopenia\\' mentioned under the ETOH Withdrawal section), and the patient has a history of alcohol dependence which can lead to cirrhosis, the specific diagnosis of cirrhosis is not explicitly stated. Additionally, there is mention of a \\'left hemi hepatectomy\\' in the surgical history, indicating prior liver surgery, but this does not confirm cirrhosis. The summary includes a comprehensive list of medical conditions under \\'Relevant Medical History,\\' but cirrhosis is notably absent from this list. Without an explicit mention of cirrhosis or compensated liver disease, I must conclude this specific fact is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides a detailed overview of the patient\\'s admission and treatment for various conditions, including ETOH withdrawal, rectal prolapse, schizophrenia, and hypertension. To determine if the fact \\'The patient also was found to have cirrhosis of the liver but has compensated disease\\' is mentioned, we need to look for any reference to liver cirrhosis or compensated liver disease in the summary. The summary mentions \\'mild liver enzyme elevations\\' under the investigations for ETOH withdrawal and lists \\'Alcohol dependence\\' in the relevant medical history. However, it does not explicitly mention \\'cirrhosis of the liver\\' or \\'compensated disease.\\' Although the patient has a history of alcohol dependence and shows mild liver enzyme elevations, indicating some liver dysfunction, the specific diagnosis of cirrhosis is not stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** Step 1: Review the \\'Relevant Medical History\\' section cirrhosis is not listed among the patient\\'s chronic conditions. Step 2: Check Problem #1 (ETOH Withdrawal) where liver related findings are mentioned (thrombocytopenia, mild liver enzyme elevations), but these are nonspecific and do not constitute a cirrhosis diagnosis. Step 3: Examine surgical history while a left hemi hepatectomy is noted, the indication for this procedure is not specified as being related to cirrhosis. Step 4: Search for terms \\'cirrhosis\\', \\'compensated liver disease\\', or clinical equivalents (e.g., portal hypertension, ascites, varices) none are present in any section. Step 5: While alcohol dependence and liver test abnormalities create clinical suspicion for cirrhosis, the summary never explicitly states this diagnosis or uses terms indicating compensated liver disease.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 10, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** The patient had alcohol ketosis on presentation \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary in detail, there is no explicit mention of alcohol ketosis or any metabolic acidosis related to alcohol use. While the patient was admitted for alcohol withdrawal and has a documented history of alcohol dependence, the summary only mentions symptoms related to withdrawal (tremors, anxiety, and headaches) and laboratory findings of thrombocytopenia, mild liver enzyme elevations, and electrolyte imbalances. There is no mention of ketosis or ketoacidosis in the laboratory findings or clinical presentation. The treatment plan includes IV fluids and various medications for withdrawal management, but nothing specifically targeting ketosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s admission for concerns of ethanol (ETOH) withdrawal and mentions various investigations and treatments related to alcohol dependence. However, it does not explicitly mention \\'alcohol ketosis\\' on presentation. The summary lists the patient\\'s history, diagnostic investigations, and therapeutic procedures but does not directly state or imply the presence of alcohol ketosis. Key diagnostic investigations included CBC, LFTs, electrolytes, and coagulation profiles, which revealed thrombocytopenia, mild liver enzyme elevations, and electrolyte imbalances, but there is no specific mention of ketosis or metabolic findings indicative of alcohol ketosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention alcohol ketosis. While the patient was admitted for ETOH withdrawal and had electrolyte imbalances (including unspecified abnormalities), there is no direct reference to ketosis, ketones, or metabolic acidosis in the diagnostic findings, clinical status, or treatment details. The IV fluids (D5 NS) and thiamine administration align with standard ETOH withdrawal management but do not specifically address ketosis. The absence of terms like \\'ketosis,\\' \\'ketonemia,\\' \\'ketonuria,\\' or \\'anion gap acidosis\\' in the documented labs or clinical assessments supports the conclusion that this fact was not stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 12, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was started on empiric antibiotics but was found to have a normal WBC with normal lactate and abx were discontinued, he was not discharged on antibiotics\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary looking for any mention of empiric antibiotics, WBC count, lactate levels, and antibiotic discontinuation. After analyzing both the detailed and summarized versions: 1. There is no mention of starting empiric antibiotics 2. There is no mention of WBC count or lactate levels 3. There is no mention of discontinuing antibiotics 4. There is no mention of antibiotic status at discharge While the summary does mention an \\'infectious workup\\' under Problem #1, it does not provide any specific details about antibiotic administration or discontinuation. The fact we\\'re looking for contains several specific elements (empiric antibiotics, normal WBC, normal lactate, antibiotic discontinuation, and discharge status) none of which are explicitly stated in the hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention the initiation of empiric antibiotics, the results of WBC and lactate tests, or the discontinuation of antibiotics. It focuses on the patient\\'s admission for management of pseudomyxoma peritonei with a new enteric fistula, cardiovascular concerns, and other chronic conditions. The summary outlines diagnostic investigations, therapeutic procedures, current clinical status, discharge plans, and outstanding issues but does not directly address antibiotic use or the specific lab results mentioned in the fact to be verified.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention the initiation or discontinuation of antibiotics. While there is a reference to \\'infectious workup\\' under Problem #1, there is no specific mention of empiric antibiotics being started, normal WBC/lactate results, or antibiotic discontinuation. The discharge plan also does not include antibiotics, but the absence of explicit documentation about their discontinuation (despite the infectious workup context) means the fact cannot be confirmed as stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 12, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was discharged on TPN with instructions to follow up in 4 weeks  \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary step by step looking for explicit mention of discharge on TPN with 4 week follow up: 1. The summary mentions TPN multiple times in the discharge plan: \\'Continue home Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)\\' \\'Discharge Plan and Goals: Continue home Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN), with a plan to discharge home with home health services\\' 2. However, while TPN at discharge is clearly mentioned, there is no explicit mention of a 4 week follow up timeframe anywhere in the text. 3. The summary mentions follow up needs in general terms (e.g., \\'follow up on CT scan\\', \\'follow up with cardiology\\') but does not specify a 4 week interval. 4. Since the specific timeframe of 4 weeks is not mentioned, we cannot consider the complete fact to be present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient is planned for discharge with \\'Continue home Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)\\' under Problem #1: Pseudomyxoma Peritonei with Enteric Fistula. However, it does not explicitly state \\'He was discharged on TPN with instructions to follow up in 4 weeks.\\' The summary does indicate that the patient will be discharged with home health services, which includes TPN, but the specific follow up timeframe of \\'4 weeks\\' is not mentioned anywhere in the provided summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states under Problem #1\\'s Discharge Plan and Goals: \\'TPN at home, home health services...\\' which confirms TPN component. However, the summary does not mention any specific 4 week follow up instruction. While follow up needs are mentioned in multiple sections (e.g., \\'CT follow up\\', \\'cardiology follow up\\'), no time frame of 4 weeks is specified anywhere in the text. The combination of TPN and a 4 week follow up instruction must both be present for the fact to be considered mentioned, and the time component is absent.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The summary explicitly mentions \\'Bilateral complete mastectomy\\' under therapeutic procedures, confirming the procedure. The postoperative course is described with stable vitals, controlled pain, and no reported complications, which aligns with \\'unremarkable.\\' However, while discharge planning is discussed (transitioning medications, wound care), there is no explicit statement that the patient was actually discharged home. The document describes the patient as being on postoperative day #2 with ongoing inpatient management (IV drips, wound care consult), indicating they were still hospitalized at the time of documentation. Thus, the discharge home is planned but not yet executed in the narrative.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 13, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt has significant mental health history including anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder and did have a panic attack while admitted \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The summary mentions several aspects of the patient\\'s mental health history but not all components specified in the fact to check. Let\\'s break it down: 1. Anxiety Confirmed in both \\'Relevant Medical History\\' and \\'Outstanding Issues\\' 2. Bipolar disorder Confirmed in \\'Relevant Medical History\\' and \\'Outstanding Issues\\' 3. PTSD Confirmed in \\'Relevant Medical History\\' and \\'Outstanding Issues\\' 4. Borderline personality disorder NOT mentioned anywhere in the summary 5. Panic attack during admission NOT mentioned anywhere in the summary While the patient clearly has significant mental health history including anxiety, bipolar disorder, and PTSD (plus depression), two key elements are missing: borderline personality disorder and the occurrence of a panic attack during admission. Since the fact we\\'re checking specifically includes all these components as a single unit, and some are missing, we must mark this as not fully present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Pt has significant mental health history including anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder and did have a panic attack while admitted\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. The hospital course summary lists the patient\\'s relevant medical history, which includes bipolar disorder, anxiety, and PTSD. However, borderline personality disorder is not mentioned in the provided summary. Additionally, there is no mention of the patient having a panic attack during admission. The presence of mental health conditions like anxiety, bipolar disorder, and PTSD is confirmed, but the complete fact is not explicitly mentioned due to the absence of \\'borderline personality disorder\\' and the specific detail about having a panic attack while admitted.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** Step 1: Review \\'Relevant Medical History\\' section. The summary explicitly lists \\'Bipolar disorder\\', \\'Anxiety\\', and \\'PTSD\\' under this section. Step 2: Check for \\'borderline personality disorder\\' this diagnosis is not mentioned anywhere in the summary. Step 3: Search for mention of a panic attack during admission. The entire hospital course summary (including problem lists, current status, discharge plans, and follow up) contains no reference to a panic attack occurring during hospitalization. Step 4: Apply guidelines while 3/4 mental health conditions are confirmed, the absence of borderline personality disorder and lack of any reference to a panic attack (even in discharge/follow up plans) means the full fact is not explicitly stated. Partial matches do not meet the threshold for \\'1\\' per the criteria.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After analyzing the hospital course summary, I found that while the patient\\'s DM2 is discussed, there is no explicit statement about whether it was or was not worsened perioperatively. In fact, the summary indicates some concerns about diabetes management during the hospital stay: 1) The patient is noted to have \\'elevated glucose levels,\\' 2) There was a need to \\'increase insulin sliding scale,\\' 3) The patient was \\'refusing blood sugar testing,\\' and 4) Diabetes management is listed as an outstanding issue requiring monitoring. These points actually suggest some perioperative challenges with diabetes management rather than stability. Without an explicit statement indicating that the diabetes remained stable or was not worsened during the perioperative period, we cannot confirm this fact is present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. To analyze this, we need to look for information regarding the patient\\'s chronic medical conditions, specifically Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (DM2), and their status perioperatively. The summary lists DM2 under Problem #2 and mentions the patient\\'s elevated glucose levels managed with medication. It also outlines a plan to continue diabetes medication and monitor blood glucose levels postoperatively. However, it does not directly state that DM2 or other chronic conditions were not worsened perioperatively. The closest relevant information is the management plan for DM2 and the overall clinical status. The summary does not explicitly state that DM2 was not worsened; it focuses on management and monitoring. Thus, the specific fact is not directly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly state that the patient\\'s chronic conditions (including DM2) were not worsened perioperatively. While DM2 management is discussed (elevated glucose levels, insulin adjustments), there is no direct statement about perioperative stability or lack of exacerbation. Other chronic conditions are listed in the medical history but no perioperative changes are mentioned. The absence of explicit documentation (even in negative terms) means this specific assertion cannot be confirmed from the text provided.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 14, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bevacizumab was initiated during hospitalization\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the entire hospital course summary, including all sections: problems #1 and #2, relevant medical history, surgical history, outstanding issues, and discharge plans. There is no mention of bevacizumab (Avastin) or any similar anti VEGF therapy being initiated during this hospitalization. The only medications explicitly mentioned in the summary are dexamethasone (initiated at 20mg IV, then transitioned to 4mg TID) and methadone (continued from home). While the patient has significant medical issues including NF1 with spinal schwannomas that might theoretically benefit from bevacizumab, the summary does not indicate that this treatment was started during this admission.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary is analyzed to determine if \\'Bevacizumab was initiated during hospitalization.\\' Upon reviewing the summary, there is no mention of Bevacizumab being initiated or administered during the hospital stay. The summary details the management of the patient\\'s Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) with spinal schwannoma burden, including the initiation of dexamethasone and continuation of home methadone, but does not reference Bevacizumab. Therefore, the fact that Bevacizumab was initiated during hospitalization is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary details therapeutic interventions including dexamethasone and methadone but does not mention Bevacizumab in any form (generic name, brand name, abbreviation, or clinical synonym). The \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' and \\'Discharge Plan\\' sections explicitly list medications initiated or continued, and Bevacizumab is absent. No other sections reference chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, or related treatments. Since Bevacizumab is not stated or implied in the summary, the fact is not mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 14, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Dexamethasone taper was started\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient was initiated on dexamethasone 20 mg IV and transitioned to 4 mg TID. It also states that there is a plan to \\'Transition to oral dexamethasone\\' as part of the discharge plan and goals. While the summary does not explicitly state \\'Dexamethasone taper was started,\\' it implies that dexamethasone was being managed with a plan for oral transition, which suggests a tapering or adjustment of the steroid regimen. However, the exact phrase \\'dexamethasone taper\\' or a clear indication that a taper was initiated is not present. The closest information is the transition plan to oral dexamethasone, which could imply tapering but is not explicit.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of viral gastroenteritis as the principal discharge diagnosis. While gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea/vomiting) are discussed in Problem #2, the summary suggests these symptoms were potentially related to ciprofloxacin treatment for UTI rather than a viral etiology. The summary discusses the management of these GI symptoms with anti emetics and notes improvement, but nowhere does it specifically state or indicate that viral gastroenteritis was the principal or final diagnosis. In fact, the GI symptoms are presented as a secondary issue to the main problem of AKI (Problem #1). The discharge planning and follow up sections also do not mention viral gastroenteritis as the principal diagnosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the principal diagnosis at discharge was \\'viral gastroenteritis\\'. The hospital course summary is analyzed for any mention of this diagnosis. Upon reviewing the summary, it is noted that the patient was admitted with gastrointestinal symptoms, specifically nausea and vomiting. However, the summary lists \\'Gastrointestinal Symptoms (Nausea/Vomiting)\\' as Problem #2 and mentions that the patient was started on ciprofloxacin for a UTI, suggesting an infectious or antibiotic related cause rather than viral gastroenteritis. There is no explicit mention of \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' in the provided summary. Therefore, the fact is not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary lists two principal problems: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and Gastrointestinal Symptoms (Nausea/Vomiting). While the gastrointestinal symptoms are addressed, the summary does not explicitly state \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' as the principal diagnosis at discharge. The text attributes the GI symptoms to recent ciprofloxacin use for a UTI and focuses on management of nausea/vomiting without specifying an infectious etiology. No clinical synonyms (e.g., \\'viral enteritis,\\' \\'stomach flu\\'), abbreviations, or diagnostic conclusions pointing to viral gastroenteritis are present. The discharge plan references monitoring for symptom recurrence but does not confirm this diagnosis. Since the fact (or an equivalent term) is absent from the entire summary, the determination is 0.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 15, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily stopped when the patient initially came to the hospital.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of temporarily stopping immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) when the patient was admitted. While tacrolimus is mentioned in the context of rechecking levels (\\'Recheck creatinine and tacrolimus levels\\'), and the patient\\'s status as immunosuppressed is noted (\\'Immunosuppression due to drug therapy\\'), there is no statement indicating that these medications were temporarily stopped. The summary discusses several medication adjustments (e.g., holding Entresto, discontinuing Zosyn) but does not specifically mention stopping immunosuppressants. Even though this would be a clinically significant action for a transplant patient with infection, we cannot assume it occurred without explicit documentation in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s management during their hospital stay. To determine if immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily stopped when the patient initially came to the hospital, we need to examine the summary closely. Under Problem #1: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), it is mentioned that \\'IV Zosyn discontinued, holding Entresto, avoiding nephrotoxic agents and contrast.\\' Additionally, under Outstanding/Pending Issues for AKI, it is noted that \\'recheck creatinine and tacrolimus levels.\\' While the summary does not explicitly state that tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone were stopped, the fact that tacrolimus levels need to be rechecked implies that tacrolimus was being held or adjusted. However, there is no direct mention of mycophenolate or prednisone being stopped. The summary does mention holding certain medications but does not specify all immunosuppressants.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'holding Entresto\\' and \\'avoiding nephrotoxic agents\\' in Problem #1 (AKI), and lists \\'recheck creatinine and tacrolimus levels\\' under Outstanding/Pending Issues. However, there is no explicit statement that immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, prednisone) were temporarily stopped. While tacrolimus levels are mentioned for rechecking, this does not confirm the medication was held. Mycophenolate and prednisone are not referenced at all in the context of being discontinued. The summary only confirms adjustments to medications like Entresto and general avoidance of nephrotoxins, but not the cessation of the specific immunosuppressants listed in the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 16, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Currently on high dose dexamethasone and Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that: 1. While dexamethasone is mentioned (\\'Continue IV dexamethasone 4mg BID\\' under Problem #1), it\\'s not specified as \\'high dose\\' 2. There is no mention of Bactrim anywhere in the summary 3. There is no mention of Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis or PJP prophylaxis 4. While the patient is on steroids, which often warrants PJP prophylaxis, the specific prophylactic regimen is not explicitly stated in the summary Therefore, while related elements are present (steroid use), the specific fact about Bactrim for PJP prophylaxis is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s current treatment, including IV dexamethasone 4mg BID. However, it does not explicitly mention \\'high dose dexamethasone.\\' The dose mentioned (4mg BID) is typically considered a moderate dose, and whether it\\'s \\'high dose\\' can depend on context, but it\\'s not overtly stated as such. Additionally, the summary does not mention Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis. Therefore, the specific fact \\'Currently on high dose dexamethasone and Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Checked the \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' section under Problem #1: The patient is prescribed \\'IV dexamethasone 4mg BID\\' but there is no mention of \\'high dose\\' (though 8mg/day might be considered high in some protocols, the term itself isn\\'t used). 2. Scanned all sections for Bactrim/Pneumocystis prophylaxis: No references to Bactrim, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, or PJP prophylaxis appear in any part of the summary. 3. Reviewed medications and prophylaxis measures: While dexamethasone use is documented, the combination with Bactrim for PJP prophylaxis a critical detail is entirely absent from the hospital course summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 17, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Delirium tremens requiring intravenous benzodiazepines and phenobarbital for symptom control\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After analyzing the hospital course summary, I find that while alcohol withdrawal and its treatment are mentioned, delirium tremens specifically is not explicitly stated. The summary indicates the patient received: 1. CIWA protocol monitoring 2. Phenobarbital 390 mg 3. Ativan (lorazepam) 2 mg IV then PO PRN 4. Thiamine supplementation While these medications (benzodiazepines and phenobarbital) are indeed commonly used to treat delirium tremens, and the treatment pattern suggests a severe withdrawal case, the specific diagnosis of delirium tremens is not explicitly mentioned. The summary only refers to \\'Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome with Perceptual Disturbance.\\' Without explicit mention of DTs, and following our guideline to only mark as present what is clearly stated, this must be scored as not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary lists \\'Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome with Perceptual Disturbance\\' as Problem #1. 2. The treatment includes phenobarbital 390 mg and Ativan (a benzodiazepine) 2 mg IV, which aligns with the fact\\'s requirement for IV benzodiazepines and phenobarbital. 3. However, the term \\'delirium tremens\\' (DT) is never explicitly stated. While the treatments described are consistent with DT management, the summary uses the broader term \\'Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome\\' instead of specifying DT. 4. The presence of perceptual disturbances and CIWA monitoring suggests moderate severe withdrawal, but the documentation avoids the DT diagnosis. 5. Since the fact specifically requires \\'delirium tremens\\' to be mentioned (even via abbreviation or synonym), and only \\'Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome\\' is documented, the fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**34. Patient 17, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, coupled with ketosis secondary to probable starvation and alcohol use\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I find no explicit mention of hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or ketosis. While alcohol use and withdrawal are prominently discussed (including treatment with phenobarbital, thiamine, and ativan), there is no mention of electrolyte abnormalities or metabolic derangements. The summary discusses lab results being pending (\\'follow up on pending lab results\\'), but does not specify any electrolyte findings. Additionally, while the patient\\'s alcohol use is clearly documented, there is no mention of starvation or ketosis. Even in the \\'Relevant Medical History\\' section, these specific metabolic issues are not mentioned. Therefore, while the patient\\'s alcohol use disorder is well documented, the specific metabolic derangements (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and ketosis) and their relationship to starvation and alcohol use are not explicitly mentioned in this summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary is analyzed for the presence of hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and ketosis secondary to probable starvation and alcohol use. Upon reviewing the summary, there is no explicit mention of \\'hypokalemia\\', \\'hypomagnesemia\\', or \\'ketosis\\'. The summary discusses the patient\\'s alcohol withdrawal syndrome and other medical issues but does not directly mention the specific fact in question. Although the patient has a history of alcohol abuse, which could imply potential electrolyte imbalances or nutritional deficiencies, the specific conditions of hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and ketosis are not stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary lists two main problems: Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome and Corneal Ulcers. 2. For Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome, the summary documents interventions (phenobarbital, thiamine, CIWA protocol) and mentions alcohol use history, but there is no explicit reference to hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or ketosis. 3. The \\'Relevant Medical History\\' section includes alcohol abuse but does not mention electrolyte abnormalities or starvation. 4. While \\'pending lab results\\' are noted under Outstanding Issues, the specific electrolyte deficiencies (hypokalemia/hypomagnesemia) or ketosis are not explicitly stated in any section. 5. Though alcohol use and potential malnutrition (implied by thiamine supplementation) are present, the summary does notationaly omit the electrolyte derangements and ketosis, even as a paraphrased form.\\n\\n\\n\\n**35. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The hospital course summary indicates that the patient \\'remains febrile\\' in the Current Clinical Status section under Problem #1. However, while fever is explicitly mentioned, there is no clear indication of a suspected pulmonary infection or negative infectious workups. The summary mentions \\'neutropenic fever with multiple admissions\\' in the Relevant Medical History section, but does not specify pulmonary involvement. While infectious disease specialists are mentioned in follow up care, there is no explicit mention of suspected pulmonary infection or negative infectious workups. Therefore, while fever is present, the complete fact as stated (persistent fever WITH suspected pulmonary infection AND negative infectious workups) is not fully documented in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary states the patient remains febrile (fever present). 2. There is no mention of suspected pulmonary infection (respiratory symptoms, imaging findings, or clinical suspicion for lung infection) in any section. 3. While neutropenic fever is listed in the medical history, this is a separate entity and not linked to pulmonary involvement. 4. No documentation of infectious workups (e.g., cultures, biomarkers, or specific infection focused testing) being performed or their results being negative. 5. The absence of both pulmonary infection suspicion and negative infectious workup documentation means the full fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**36. Patient 18, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma recently complicated by progression to CNS lymphoma\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary describes \\'high grade B cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 translocations\\' and \\'leptomeningeal involvement/disease\\' (a form of CNS involvement). However, it does not use the term \\'Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma\\' (DLBCL) or explicitly state that the lymphoma \\'progressed\\' to CNS involvement. While high grade B cell lymphoma with MYC/BCL2 rearrangements may overlap clinically with DLBCL, the leptomeningeal involvement is presented as a concurrent finding rather than a documented progression event. The absence of both the specific DLBCL terminology and explicit language describing progression to CNS lymphoma (despite confirming CNS involvement) means the fact is not fully articulated as stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**37. Patient 18, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) or hypokalemia, nor their resolution. The summary focuses primarily on the patient\\'s lymphoma, leptomeningeal disease, and related treatments. While the summary discusses various complications and medical issues including neutropenic fever, biliary obstruction, and CNS involvement, it does not mention any kidney related problems or electrolyte disturbances. The discharge plan and outstanding issues sections also do not reference any kidney function concerns or potassium level management. Therefore, we cannot confirm that AKI with hypokalemia occurred or resolved during this admission.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact \\'Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\' is mentioned in the hospital course summary, I will systematically review the provided summary. The summary is structured around specific problems, relevant medical and surgical history, outstanding issues, and discharge plans. I will check each section for any mention of \\'acute kidney injury,\\' \\'hypokalemia,\\' or related terms. Upon reviewing the summary, there is no explicit mention of \\'acute kidney injury\\' or \\'hypokalemia\\' in any of the sections, including the problems listed, medical and surgical history, or outstanding issues and discharge plans. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed section by section. Problem #1 focuses on lymphoma management, Problem #2 on leptomeningeal disease. Relevant medical/surgical histories, discharge plans, and outstanding issues were reviewed. No mention of acute kidney injury (AKI), hypokalemia, or resolution of electrolyte/renal issues was found in diagnostic results, therapeutic interventions, current status, discharge documentation, or follow up plans. The summary emphasizes oncological and neurological care without renal complications.\\n\\n\\n\\n**38. Patient 19, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis).\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, while hydronephrosis is mentioned (\\'CT abd/pelvis showed... bilateral hydronephrosis\\' under Problem #2), the specific combination of hydronephrosis being complicated by UTIs with ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis is not explicitly stated. The summary does mention UTIs (Problem #1) and specifically notes E. Faecalis in blood culture, but does not mention ESBL E. coli or Klebsiella. Additionally, while both conditions (hydronephrosis and UTIs) are present, the summary does not explicitly state that the hydronephrosis is complicated by these specific infections. The causal or complicating relationship between the hydronephrosis and the UTIs with these specific organisms is not clearly established in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient has recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and bilateral hydronephrosis. The summary under Problem #1: Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections lists the key diagnostic investigations and results, which include urinalysis showing WBC 51 100, rare bacteria, mod pseudo hyphae, many yeast, and blood culture growing E. Faecalis. Under Problem #2: Neurogenic Bladder with Suprapubic Catheter, it is noted that CT abd/pelvis showed chronic bladder wall thickening and bilateral hydronephrosis. However, the specific fact about hydronephrosis being complicated by urinary tract infections (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis) is not explicitly mentioned in its entirety. The presence of hydronephrosis and UTIs is noted, and E. Faecalis is mentioned as one of the pathogens in the blood culture. However, ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella are not mentioned in the provided summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Hydronephrosis is explicitly mentioned in Problem #2 under \\'CT abd/pelvis showed... bilateral hydronephrosis.\\' 2. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are documented in Problem #1 (Recurrent UTIs) and Problem #2 (cloudy urine indicating possible UTI). 3. Enterococcus faecalis (E. Faecalis) is identified in blood culture results in Problem #1. 4. However, ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella are not mentioned anywhere in the summary. While yeast/pseudo hyphae are noted on urinalysis, no bacterial species beyond E. Faecalis are specified in the UTI context. 5. The specific combination of hydronephrosis being complicated by UTIs caused by all three organisms (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis) is not explicitly stated. Only E. Faecalis is confirmed, with no evidence of the other two pathogens.\\n\\n\\n\\n**39. Patient 19, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left lower pole calyx filling defect\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact \\'left lower pole calyx filling defect\\' is partially mentioned in the text. The summary refers to a \\'calyx filling defect\\' multiple times but does not specifically identify it as being in the left lower pole. The references appear in: 1. Problem #1 under \\'Outstanding/Pending Issues\\': \\'outpatient urology consultation recommended for calyx filling defect\\' 2. Problem #2 under \\'Outstanding/Pending Issues\\': \\'evaluate calyx filling defect outpatient\\' 3. Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section: \\'Evaluate calyx filling defect outpatient, possibly via cystoscopy\\' 4. Discharge Planning section: \\'Outpatient urology consultation for calyx filling defect\\' While a calyx filling defect is clearly mentioned, the specific location (left lower pole) is not explicitly stated anywhere in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'calyx filling defect\\' in two contexts: 1) Under Problem #1\\'s Outstanding/Pending Issues: \\'outpatient urology consultation recommended for calyx filling defect\\' and 2) Under Problem #2\\'s Outstanding/Pending Issues: \\'evaluate calyx filling defect outpatient.\\' However, neither instance specifies the location as the left lower pole calyx. The summary uses the general term \\'calyx filling defect\\' without anatomical localization. While the defect is clearly identified as requiring evaluation, the specific left lower pole location is not explicitly stated in any section of the document.\\n\\n\\n\\n**40. Patient 20, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** HHT with new PE/DVT s/p IVC filter placement as well as changed to fondaparinux\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'HHT with new PE/DVT s/p IVC filter placement as well as changed to fondaparinux\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. Breaking down the fact: 1. \\'HHT\\' is mentioned under Problem #1. 2. \\'new PE/DVT\\' The summary mentions \\'multifocal PEs with pulmonary infarcts\\' and a history of RLE DVT under Problem #2, indicating the presence of PE/DVT. 3. \\'s/p IVC filter placement\\' is documented under \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' in Problem #2 and \\'Relevant Surgical History\\'. 4. \\'changed to fondaparinux\\' The summary states the patient was on \\'fondaparinux prophylaxis\\' and later transitioned to apixaban, indicating that fondaparinux was the initial anticoagulant. The fact that it was \\'changed to fondaparinux\\' is not accurate; instead, fondaparinux was started and then changed to apixaban. The summary does not explicitly state \\'new PE/DVT\\'; it mentions a history of RLE DVT and current multifocal PEs. However, the presence of \\'HHT\\', \\'PE/DVT\\', \\'IVC filter placement\\', and the transition from \\'fondaparinux to apixaban\\' are all documented. The phrase \\'changed to fondaparinux\\' is misleading because the patient was initially on fondaparinux and then changed to apixaban. Despite this, the key elements are present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) HHT is explicitly mentioned in the patient\\'s history and problem list. 2) PE/DVT are documented as \\'recurrent\\' rather than explicitly \\'new,\\' though they represent the acute reason for admission. 3) IVC filter placement is clearly stated in both procedures and surgical history. 4) The anticoagulation course shows fondaparinux was used initially but transitioned to apixaban the summary specifies a change FROM fondaparinux rather than TO fondaparinux. While all individual components exist, the critical \\'changed to fondaparinux\\' element is contradicted by the documented transition to apixaban. A physician would recognize the direction of anticoagulation change as opposite to what\\'s stated in the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**41. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After analyzing the hospital course summary, I found that worsening thrombocytopenia and prednisone taper initiation are not explicitly mentioned as stated. Here\\'s my analysis: 1. Thrombocytopenia is clearly documented (Problem #3) with a platelet count nadir of 42 and subsequent improvement to 82 2. Prednisone treatment is mentioned with an INCREASE in dosage (from 40mg to 100mg daily), not a taper 3. While thrombocytopenia is present, there\\'s no explicit mention of it \\'worsening\\' only the initial low count and subsequent improvement 4. The summary specifically notes prednisone dose escalation, which is the opposite of a taper While thrombocytopenia management is a key part of the hospital course, the specific combination of \\'worsening thrombocytopenia\\' with \\'prednisone taper initiation\\' is not present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s management for thrombocytopenia, including the administration of prednisone. Under Problem #3: Thrombocytopenia, it is stated that \\'Prednisone 40mg daily, later increased to 100mg\\' was given, and the patient\\'s platelet count improved from a nadir of 42 to 82. The summary also mentions that the discharge plan includes continuing prednisone and monitoring the platelet count. However, the specific phrase \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\' is not directly mentioned. The summary does indicate an improvement in platelet count after prednisone was administered and increased, but it does not explicitly state that there was a worsening after a taper initiation. The closest relevant information is the improvement after prednisone was given and increased, and the plan to continue it, but the exact fact of \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\' is not present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions thrombocytopenia management with prednisone (initially 40mg, increased to 100mg) and improved platelet counts (42 → 82). However, there is no mention of \\'worsening thrombocytopenia\\' (platelets improved) or a prednisone taper (dose was increased, not reduced). The term \\'s/p prednisone taper initiation\\' implies a recent start of dose reduction, which is absent in the text. While prednisone therapy is documented, the specific action of tapering is not described.\\n\\n\\n\\n**42. Patient 20, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary, including the problem list, discharge plan, and outstanding issues sections. While the summary mentions several monitoring requirements (including monitoring platelet count and signs of bleeding), there is no explicit mention of ordering twice weekly CBCs after discharge. The summary indicates that platelet monitoring is needed (\\'Monitor platelet count and adjust prednisone dosage as needed\\') but does not specify the frequency of this monitoring. The closest references are in Problem #3 and the Outstanding Issues sections, but neither specifies twice weekly CBC monitoring. Given that this specific monitoring frequency is not mentioned anywhere in the text, I must conclude this fact is not explicitly present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if the fact \\'Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\' is explicitly mentioned. Upon reviewing the summary, the discharge plan for Problem #3: Thrombocytopenia includes \\'monitor platelet count.\\' Additionally, the \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section mentions \\'Monitor platelet count and adjust prednisone dosage as needed.\\' While these sections imply the need for monitoring platelet count post discharge, they do not explicitly state the frequency of CBC monitoring. The summary does not directly mention \\'twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\' or an equivalent phrase. Therefore, the specific fact of ordering twice weekly CBCs after discharge is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions monitoring platelet count as part of the discharge plan (e.g., \\'monitor platelet count\\' in Problem #3\\'s discharge plan and \\'monitor INR and platelet count\\' in the summary). However, there is no explicit mention of the frequency \\'twice weekly\\' for CBCs. While platelet counts are typically part of a CBC, the specific instruction for twice weekly frequency is absent in all sections, including discharge plans, follow up, and summary. The text only refers to general monitoring without specifying the interval.\\n\\n\\n\\n**43. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, while falls are mentioned multiple times, there is no explicit mention of falls being of unknown etiology or having an extensive inpatient workup that failed to determine the cause. The summary actually suggests known contributing factors to the falls: 1) The admission note states falls are \\'likely due to recurrent falls and gait instability\\' 2) Medications like Gabapentin were adjusted due to fall risk 3) The patient has multiple comorbidities that could contribute to falls (heart failure, dementia, etc.). Additionally, while diagnostic tests were performed, they weren\\'t specifically described as part of a falls workup, and there\\'s no indication that the etiology remained unknown after investigation. Therefore, while falls are clearly a major issue for this patient, the specific fact of \\'recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\' is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'recurrent falls with gait instability\\' in the patient\\'s medical history and presentation. However, it attributes the falls to identifiable factors such as gait instability, heart failure, and medication risks (e.g., gabapentin use). Diagnostic workup revealed specific findings (T6 fracture, pleural effusion) that may contribute to falls. While the summary describes evaluations (CT, EKG, Echo) and interventions for fall prevention, it does not state that the etiology of falls remains unknown despite extensive inpatient workup. Instead, it identifies plausible contributors, making the \\'unknown etiology\\' aspect unmentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**44. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention that the T6 wedge compression fracture likely occurred before the most recent fall. While the summary does document the presence of a T6 wedge compression fracture (confirmed by CT imaging) and mentions \\'multiple falls\\' and \\'recurrent falls,\\' it does not specify the timing of the fracture in relation to these falls. The summary simply states it as a \\'new T6 wedge compression fracture\\' without indicating whether it predated the most recent fall. The temporal relationship between the fracture and the falls is not addressed in the diagnostic findings, hospital course, or any other section of the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states \\'Diagnostic investigations confirmed a new T6 wedge compression fracture\\' and mentions the patient presented \\'after multiple falls at home.\\' However, there is no explicit mention in the text that the T6 fracture \\'likely happened before the most recent fall.\\' While the summary documents the fracture and the context of recurrent falls, it does not provide temporal clarification about when the fracture occurred relative to the timing of the most recent fall. The term \\'new\\' could imply recent occurrence, but this does not specifically address whether it preceded the latest fall. No clinical synonyms or paraphrased statements establish this temporal relationship.\\n\\n\\n\\n**45. Patient 22, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary looking for explicit mention of post procedural cholangitis following a recent biliary stent exchange. While the summary mentions several related elements (biliary drain exchange, infection/sepsis with fever and leukocytosis, empiric Zosyn treatment, and biliary issues), it does not explicitly state that the patient developed cholangitis specifically following a stent exchange procedure. Problem #5 describes infection/sepsis symptoms that could be consistent with cholangitis (fever, leukocytosis, worsening hyperbilirubinemia), and Problem #2 mentions a biliary drain exchange, but the summary never explicitly connects these events as post procedural cholangitis following stent exchange. Without an explicit mention of cholangitis as a post procedural complication, we cannot definitively say this specific fact is present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if \\'post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, it is structured around several problems, including issues related to biliary drain placement and management. Under Problem #5: Infection/Sepsis, it is mentioned that the patient had fever, leukocytosis, and worsening hyperbilirubinemia, and that empiric Zosyn was started. The presence of fever and leukocytosis along with the context of biliary drain exchange (mentioned under Problem #2: Hyperbilirubinemia) suggests an infectious process. While \\'cholangitis\\' is not directly mentioned, the clinical presentation and context imply a possible biliary infection. However, the exact phrase \\'post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\' is not present. The summary does mention \\'biliary drain exchange with additional drain placement\\' under Problem #2 and signs of infection under Problem #5, but it does not explicitly link these as \\'post procedural cholangitis.\\'\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions several relevant elements but does not explicitly state \\'post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange.\\' Key points analyzed: 1. Biliary procedures : The patient underwent biliary drain exchange (Problem #2) and ERCP/stent placement (Problem #1). 2. Infection signs : Fevers, chills, purulent drainage, leukocytosis, and empiric antibiotics (Zosyn) are documented (Problems #1, #5). 3. Cholangitis terminology : While clinical features of infection (including biliary involvement) are present, the term \\'cholangitis\\' or an unambiguous synonym (e.g., \\'biliary infection\\') is absent. 4. Causality linkage : The summary does not explicitly connect the infection to the biliary stent/drain procedures, though temporal proximity is implied. Conclusion: The fact requires both procedural context (stent exchange) and explicit cholangitis terminology. While components exist separately, the specific combination is not stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**46. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of Augmentin therapy or any recommendation to re evaluate its continuation prior to a 14 day completion. While the summary does discuss antibiotic therapy, it specifically mentions Zosyn (Problem #1 and Problem #5) as the empiric antibiotic being used. The discharge plans and outstanding issues sections mention continuing antibiotic therapy but do not specify Augmentin or discuss a 14 day course. The infection/sepsis section (Problem #5) only mentions Zosyn and does not reference Augmentin or plans to re evaluate antibiotic choice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'should continue and re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, it is noted that the patient is being treated for an infection/sepsis under Problem #5. The therapeutic procedure performed includes starting empiric Zosyn, not Augmentin. The discharge plan for Problem #5 includes continuing antibiotic therapy and monitoring infection markers. Although the summary mentions continuing antibiotic therapy, it does not specifically mention Augmentin or the need to re evaluate its continuation before 14 days. Therefore, the specific fact regarding Augmentin therapy is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1. The key fact to identify is any mention of needing to reassess continuation of Augmentin therapy before completing 14 days. 2. Reviewing all sections of the hospital course summary: Under Problem #5 (Infection/Sepsis), the discharge plan states \\'Continue antibiotic therapy\\' with Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam), not Augmentin. The \\'Outstanding Issues\\' for Problem #5 mention monitoring infection resolution but no Augmentin specific guidance. 3. Augmentin (amoxicillin clavulanate) is never mentioned in the entire document. The only antibiotic referenced in treatment plans is Zosyn. 4. While antibiotic continuation is mentioned generally, there is no specific reference to Augmentin therapy duration reassessment. 5. No clinical synonyms or abbreviations for Augmentin (e.g., amox clav) appear in the text. Thus, the specific fact about Augmentin therapy re evaluation is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**47. Patient 22, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** patient should follow up with Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/ Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Poultsides, George, MD in in 2 weeks\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, including the Problems section and the Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section, there is no explicit mention of follow up appointments with either an Advanced Practice Provider in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides, George, MD in 2 weeks. While the summary does mention several follow up needs (including radiation oncology follow up, dietitian follow up, and the need to monitor various conditions), it does not specify these particular provider appointments or their timing. The closest references are general statements about follow up care, but not the specific scheduling details being searched for.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s diagnosis, treatment, and discharge plan across various medical issues. To determine if the specific fact about follow up appointments is mentioned, we need to look for any reference to follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant) and Dr. Poultsides, George, MD. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists several follow up actions, including coordination with radiation oncology for a follow up appointment. However, it does not explicitly mention follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides, George, MD in 2 weeks. Therefore, the specific fact is not explicitly mentioned in the provided summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary\\'s \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists multiple follow up requirements, including coordination with radiation oncology, outpatient dietitian, diabetes management, and others. However, there is no explicit mention of a follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant) in 1 week or with \\'Poultsides, George, MD\\' in 2 weeks. While follow ups are broadly mentioned (e.g., \\'radiation oncology follow up\\'), the specific providers and timelines in the fact are not stated. The name \\'Poultsides\\' does not appear in the text, and no APP related follow up timeframe is documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**48. Patient 23, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** large pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The provided hospital course summary appears to be empty or contains an error message (\\'Failed with phi 3.5 mini instruct: \\'choices\\'\\'). Without any actual clinical information to analyze, it\\'s impossible to determine whether a large pleural effusion with subsequent thoracentesis was mentioned. Therefore, we must conclude that this specific fact is not present in the given text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task requires analyzing the provided hospital course summary to determine if it explicitly mentions \\'large pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis\\'. The given summary is \\'Failed with phi 3.5 mini instruct: choices\\'. This text does not contain any relevant medical information regarding the patient\\'s condition or procedures performed, such as \\'large pleural effusion\\' or \\'thoracentesis\\'. Therefore, the fact is not mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The provided hospital course summary appears to be an error message (\\'Failed with phi 3.5 mini instruct: \\'choices\\'\\') rather than a clinical narrative. There is no mention of pleural effusion, thoracentesis, or any procedural interventions in the text. The summary lacks any medical terminology or clinical context required to identify the specified fact. Since no patient related details are present, the fact cannot be confirmed as mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**49. Patient 23, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The hospital course summary provided appears to be incomplete or corrupted, showing only an error message \\'Failed with phi 3.5 mini instruct: \\'choices\\'\\'. Without a proper hospital course summary to analyze, it\\'s impossible to find any mention of progressing CLL (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia) and mitral valvulopathy. Since there is no actual clinical content to review, the fact cannot be considered as explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary provided (\\'Failed with phi 3.5 mini instruct: \\'choices\\'\\') contains no clinical information. There is no mention of CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia), mitral valvulopathy, disease progression, or any related clinical context. The text appears to be an error message or placeholder rather than a medical summary. Without any identifiable medical terminology or context, neither component of the target fact (progressing CLL or mitral valvulopathy) is present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**50. Patient 23, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Unable to analyze whether the specified fact is present because no hospital course summary was provided in the input. The text appears to show an error message (\\'Failed with phi 3.5 mini instruct: \\'choices\\'\\') rather than actual clinical documentation. Without a proper hospital course summary to examine, it\\'s impossible to determine if the fact about cardiology coordination, Heart Failure team follow up, and transcatheter MVR discussion is mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task requires analyzing the provided hospital course summary to determine if a specific fact is explicitly mentioned. The fact to look for is: \\'Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\'. Upon examining the given summary, it is evident that there is no text provided for analysis, as indicated by \\'Failed with phi 3.5 mini instruct: choices\\'. Therefore, it is not possible to find the specified fact within the summary because the summary itself is missing or not provided. Consequently, the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The provided \\'Hospital Course Summary\\' contains the text \\'Failed with phi 3.5 mini instruct: \\'choices\\'\\' which appears to be an error message or placeholder text rather than a valid medical summary. There is no clinical information present in this text to analyze. The specified fact about cardiology coordinating follow up with the Heart Failure team regarding transcatheter MVR and a clinical trial drug is entirely absent from this non clinical content.\\n\\n\\n\\n**51. Patient 24, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Analyzing the hospital course summary step by step: 1. The discharge plan mentions \\'start full liquids\\' under Problem #1 (SBO) 2. However, there is no explicit mention of the patient being discharged on pain medications 3. While pain control is mentioned (\\'Patient clinically stable with controlled pain\\'), the summary does not specify that oral pain medications were prescribed at discharge 4. The discharge plan discusses diet advancement and monitoring but does not explicitly state the final discharge diet status 5. Though it\\'s likely the patient received pain medications, we cannot assume details not explicitly stated in the summary\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary outlines the patient\\'s treatment and discharge plan for two main problems: Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO) and Nutritional Risk. Under Problem #1: SBO, the discharge plan includes \\'start full liquids, monitor for tolerance, and advance diet as tolerated.\\' Additionally, under Problem #2: Nutritional Risk and in the Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section, there are mentions of advancing the diet as tolerated and focusing on high protein/nutrient dense meals. However, the specific mention of \\'discharged on full liquid diet\\' is directly supported by the discharge plan under Problem #1. Moreover, \\'oral pain medications\\' are not explicitly mentioned in the summary, but there is a mention of \\'controlled pain,\\' indicating pain management. The summary does not directly state that the patient was discharged on oral pain medications.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed Problem #1\\'s Discharge Plan: \\'start full liquids\\' is explicitly stated under discharge goals, confirming the liquid diet component. 2. Searched all sections (Therapeutic Procedures, Current Status, Discharge Plans) for pain medication references: \\'controlled pain\\' is noted in clinical status but no mention of oral pain medications. 3. Checked Outstanding Issues and Follow Up: Diet advancement instructions are present but no reference to oral analgesics. 4. Conclusion: While full liquid diet at discharge is clearly documented, oral pain medications are not explicitly mentioned in any form (abbreviation, synonym, or paraphrase).\\n\\n\\n\\n**52. Patient 25, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step: 1. The fact mentions specific findings from an Upper GI series and subsequent management including: No gastric outlet obstruction No significant duodenal obstruction IV famotidine treatment Switch to PPI GI consultation recommendations 2. Looking at the hospital course, under Problem #2 \\'Duodenitis and gastric distention\\': The text mentions \\'Upper GI contrast study showed no significant obstruction\\' It notes IV famotidine was initiated GI consultation is mentioned PPI switch is referenced 3. While some elements match (Upper GI study findings, famotidine/PPI treatment), the specific details about GI and advanced GI deferring EGD/ERCP and recommending empiric PPI for 8 weeks are not explicitly mentioned in this format. 4. The exact duration (8 weeks) of PPI treatment is not specified in the summary. 5. While ERCP is mentioned as a consideration, the specific consultation details and timing recommendations are not explicitly stated as described in the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**53. Patient 25, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) on admission or its treatment with fluids. The summary details multiple medical problems including ascites, portal vein thrombosis, duodenitis, elevated liver function tests, leukocytosis, hypothyroidism, and rhinovirus infection, but kidney function or AKI is not mentioned as one of the problems. While fluid management is discussed in the context of paracentesis and diuretic therapy (Lasix and Aldactone), these interventions were specifically for managing ascites rather than treating AKI. There is no mention of elevated creatinine, decreased GFR, or any other markers that would indicate AKI was present on admission or that it resolved with fluid treatment.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary is analyzed to determine if it mentions \\'AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved\\'. The summary lists several problems the patient faced during their hospital stay, including large volume ascites, duodenitis, elevated liver function tests, leukocytosis, hypothyroidism, and Rhinovirus infection. However, it does not explicitly mention Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) on admission or its treatment with fluids. The summary details various diagnostic investigations, therapeutic procedures, and the patient\\'s clinical status for each problem but does not reference AKI or its management.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed for any mention of AKI (acute kidney injury) on admission treated with fluids that resolved. The summary lists six problems managed during the hospitalization: ascites/PVT, duodenitis/gastric distention, elevated LFTs, leukocytosis, hypothyroidism, and rhinovirus. None of these sections mention AKI, fluid resuscitation for AKI, or resolution of AKI. While the patient received diuretics (Lasix/Aldactone) for ascites and had a history of cancer related complications, there is no explicit reference to AKI diagnosis, fluid treatment for AKI, or its improvement. The absence of AKI related terminology (e.g., creatinine changes, renal insufficiency) or fluid management specifically targeting AKI supports the conclusion that this fact is not documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**54. Patient 26, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient experienced acute atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, likely precipitated by dehydration.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step: 1. The summary mentions \\'rapid ventricular response\\' in multiple places: In the opening paragraph: \\'Initial rapid ventricular response was managed with IV fluids and rate control medications\\' Under Problem #1: \\'Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR)\\' 2. The text indicates dehydration/hypovolemia as a precipitating factor: \\'presented with severe nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain due to hypovolemia\\' Treatment included \\'IV fluids\\' 3. However, while the text mentions RVR, it does not specifically mention \\'atrial flutter\\' anywhere in the summary. 4. The cardiac rhythm issue is referenced only as \\'RVR\\' and \\'heart rhythm management\\', but the specific type of arrhythmia (atrial flutter) is not explicitly stated. 5. While the clinical scenario is consistent with atrial flutter with RVR, we cannot assume its presence without explicit mention.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** Step 1: Search for \\'atrial flutter\\' Not found in the summary. The text only references \\'rapid ventricular response (RVR)\\' without specifying the underlying rhythm as atrial flutter. Step 2: Check for dehydration as a precipitant Hypovolemia (a form of dehydration) is listed as the cause of presenting symptoms, and IV fluids were administered. However, no explicit link is made between hypovolemia/dehydration and RVR causation. Step 3: Evaluate clinical synonyms While RVR management is described, the summary never pairs it with atrial flutter (or equivalent terms like AFL). The phrase \\'likely precipitated by dehydration\\' is absent, and while hypovolemia is present, the causal relationship to RVR isn\\'t explicitly stated. Conclusion: The specific combination of atrial flutter with RVR and its attribution to dehydration isn\\'t explicitly documented, though components of the fact (RVR, hypovolemia) are separately present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**55. Patient 26, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Metoprolol dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily for improved rate control; Apixaban dosage increased to 5 mg twice daily for anticoagulation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I find that the fact is partially mentioned but not completely. The summary does confirm that metoprolol was increased to 75 mg BID (twice daily) in the Problem #1 section (\\'Continue metoprolol 75 mg BID\\'). However, while apixaban is mentioned as being continued for VTE prophylaxis in Problem #3, there is no explicit mention of increasing its dosage to 5 mg twice daily. The summary only states \\'Continue anticoagulation therapy with apixaban\\' in the Discharge Plan Summary without specifying the dose. Since both components of the fact must be present for it to be considered fully mentioned, and only one component is explicitly stated, this would be considered not fully mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if the fact \\'Metoprolol dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily for improved rate control; Apixaban dosage increased to 5 mg twice daily for anticoagulation\\' is explicitly mentioned. Upon reviewing the summary, it is noted that under \\'Problem #1: Gastroparesis and Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR)\\', the discharge plan states \\'Continue metoprolol 75 mg BID\\', indicating that the metoprolol dosage was indeed increased to 75 mg twice daily. However, there is no explicit mention of the apixaban dosage being increased to 5 mg twice daily. The summary does mention \\'Continue anticoagulation therapy with apixaban\\' under \\'Discharge Plan Summary\\' and \\'Continued home apixaban for VTE prophylaxis\\' under \\'Problem #3: Extranodal MZL of RUL post XRT\\', but it does not specify the dosage. Therefore, only part of the fact is explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Metoprolol: The discharge plan under Problem #1 explicitly states \\'Continue metoprolol 75 mg BID.\\' This matches the dosage increase described in the target fact. 2. Apixaban: While the summary mentions continuing anticoagulation with apixaban in both Problem #3 and the Discharge Plan Summary, it does NOT specify a dosage increase to 5 mg BID. The phrase \\'continued home apixaban\\' implies maintenance of a pre existing dose rather than an increase. Since only the metoprolol dosage change is explicitly stated and the apixaban dosage change is absent, the full fact is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**56. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact can be pieced together from the following elements in the summary: 1) The patient presented with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. 2) Under Problem #1, it\\'s explicitly noted that \\'CT angiography showed SMA stenosis.\\' 3) However, while both the symptoms and the SMA stenosis are mentioned, the summary does not explicitly state or suggest a causal relationship between the emesis and chronic mesenteric ischemia. The SMA stenosis finding is mentioned only in passing under the gastroparesis section, and the clinical team appears to be attributing the patient\\'s symptoms primarily to gastroparesis rather than mesenteric ischemia. Without an explicit connection being made between these elements, we cannot say this specific fact is mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient underwent CT angiography, which showed SMA (superior mesenteric artery) stenosis. It also lists the patient\\'s symptoms, including severe nausea and vomiting. Although the summary does not directly state that the patient\\'s emesis is related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, it provides the necessary components to infer a potential link: the presence of SMA stenosis and the symptoms of nausea and vomiting. The fact that the SMA stenosis is mentioned under \\'Problem #1: Gastroparesis and Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR)\\' alongside the patient\\'s symptoms of nausea and vomiting suggests that the SMA stenosis could be considered in the context of these symptoms. However, the summary does not explicitly state that the emesis is related to chronic mesenteric ischemia. Therefore, the specific fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly mentions CT angiography showed SMA stenosis under Problem #1\\'s diagnostic investigations. 2. The summary documents the patient presented with vomiting and lists gastroparesis as a key diagnosis. 3. While SMA stenosis (a hallmark of chronic mesenteric ischemia) is identified, there is no explicit statement linking this finding to the patient\\'s emesis. 4. The text attributes symptoms to gastroparesis and hypovolemia, but does not propose mesenteric ischemia as a potential contributor to vomiting. 5. Though a clinician might consider this association, the summary itself does not make this connection explicit through any phrasing.\\n\\n\\n\\n**57. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient was admitted for neutropenic fever. 2. The bacteremia is identified as \\'Coag Negative Staph\\' (coagulase negative staphylococcus), not \\'coagulase negative strep\\' (streptococcus). While \\'Staph\\' and \\'Strep\\' are both bacteria, they are distinct genera with different clinical implications. 3. The summary confirms PICC line removal and antibiotic treatment (Zosyn, Vancomycin, linezolid). 4. The critical discrepancy lies in the organism: \\'Staph\\' is explicitly documented, but the fact specifies \\'Strep,\\' which is not mentioned. Since the organism is a key clinical detail and no synonymous terms for \\'Strep\\' are present, the fact as stated is not fully matched.\\n\\n\\n\\n**58. Patient 27, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the provided hospital course summary, I do not find any mention of a TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) being performed on 3/6/23 or any other date. The summary includes various diagnostic tests and procedures, including blood cultures and CT maxillofacial imaging, but does not reference any cardiac imaging. While the patient had bacteremia that might typically warrant a TTE to rule out endocarditis, there is no explicit mention of an echocardiogram or its findings regarding mass or vegetations. The diagnostic investigations listed focus primarily on the infectious workup and oral health assessment.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, it is clear that there is no mention of a Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) being performed on March 6, 2023, or any findings related to it. The summary discusses the patient\\'s neutropenic fever, oral health issues, and relevant medical history but does not include any information about a TTE. Therefore, the fact is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed in detail. The fact being checked is \\'TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations.\\' The summary explicitly lists diagnostic investigations for neutropenic fever (blood cultures, CT maxillofacial) and oral health issues, but no transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is mentioned in the \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results,\\' \\'Relevant Medical History,\\' \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up,\\' or summary sections. The date 3/6/23 is not associated with any imaging study in the text. There are no references to cardiac imaging, masses, vegetations, or abbreviations/synonyms for TTE (e.g., echocardiogram, cardiac ultrasound). Since the fact is entirely absent, it is not considered mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**59. Patient 27, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, while there is mention of \\'mildly enlarged tonsils\\' in the CT maxillofacial findings, there is no explicit mention of tonsillitis or symptoms specifically localizing to the tonsils. The antibiotics mentioned (Zosyn, Vancomycin, and linezolid) were prescribed for bacteremia rather than tonsillitis. The patient\\'s symptoms included fever, frontal headache, and maxillary pain, but these were not specifically attributed to tonsillar infection. The oral health issues discussed focused primarily on dental caries and oral thrush, which was treated with antifungals (fluconazole and nystatin), not antibiotics for tonsillitis. Therefore, while there were oral health problems, tonsillitis with associated treatment was not explicitly documented.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact \\'Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics\\' is mentioned in the hospital course summary, we need to analyze the provided text. The summary is divided into sections including \\'Hospital Course/Significant Findings by Problem\\' and \\'Summary\\'. We will look for any mention of tonsillitis, imaging related to it, symptoms (sx) suggesting tonsillitis, and treatment with antibiotics. 1. Problem #1: Neutropenic Fever This section discusses the patient\\'s neutropenic fever, treatment with antibiotics (Zosyn and Vancomycin), and the presence of Coag Negative Staph bacteremia. There\\'s no direct mention of tonsillitis. 2. Problem #2: Oral Health Issues This section mentions a CT maxillofacial showing mildly enlarged tonsils, indicating some issue related to the tonsils. It also discusses treatment for oral thrush with fluconazole and nystatin, but does not mention antibiotics for tonsillitis. 3. Relevant Medical History and Outstanding Issues/Follow Up These sections do not directly mention tonsillitis or its treatment. 4. Summary The summary highlights the patient\\'s admission for neutropenic fever, treatment with antibiotics, and addressing oral health issues, but does not explicitly mention tonsillitis or its treatment with antibiotics. The CT maxillofacial showed \\'mildly enlarged tonsils\\', which can be considered as imaging suggesting possible tonsillitis. However, the summary does not explicitly state that the patient was treated with antibiotics for tonsillitis. The antibiotics (Zosyn and Vancomycin) were used for treating Coag Negative Staph bacteremia associated with neutropenic fever. While there is a mention of \\'mildly enlarged tonsils\\' from the CT maxillofacial, which could be interpreted as a symptom localizing to the tonsils, and the patient was on antibiotics, the connection between the antibiotics and tonsillitis is not explicitly made in the summary. The antibiotics were primarily for Coag Negative Staph bacteremia. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned as the summary does not clearly state that the antibiotics were used to treat tonsillitis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary mentions a CT maxillofacial showing \\'mildly enlarged tonsils\\' under Problem #2 (Oral Health Issues). 2. No localizing symptoms specific to tonsillitis (e.g., sore throat, dysphagia, erythema/exudate) are described in the text. The listed symptoms (fever, headache, maxillary pain) are attributed to neutropenic fever and oral health issues. 3. While antibiotics (Zosyn, Vancomycin, linezolid) were used, they were explicitly directed at treating Coag Negative Staph bacteremia and neutropenic fever, not tonsillitis. 4. The enlarged tonsils are noted as an incidental imaging finding without clinical correlation to infection requiring antibiotic treatment in this context. No antibiotic therapy was initiated specifically for tonsillar pathology.\\n\\n\\n\\n**60. Patient 28, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step: 1. The summary mentions biliary obstruction and hyperbilirubinemia as key issues 2. PTBD (Percutaneous Transhepatic Biliary Drainage) is mentioned in the surgical history as \\'IR biliary drain exchange\\' 3. However, while the text mentions these elements separately, it does not explicitly state that a PTBD exchange occurred specifically on 4/21/23 4. The text confirms the patient has \\'recurrent\\' issues with biliary obstruction and mentions it is \\'malignant\\' (given the context of cholangiocarcinoma) 5. While the clinical scenario matches, the specific date (4/21/23) of PTBD exchange is not mentioned anywhere in the summary 6. Therefore, while the clinical condition and intervention type are present, the complete fact with the specific date is not explicitly stated\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, it is noted that the patient was admitted for biliary obstruction and weakness, and had a history of distal cholangiocarcinoma. The summary mentions that the patient underwent multiple interventions including ERCP with stent placement and PTBD due to recurrent hyperbilirubinemia and biliary dilation. However, the specific date \\'4/21/23\\' for PTBD exchange is not mentioned in the provided summary. The summary does indicate that a PTBD exchange was performed, aligning with part of the fact in question, but it lacks the specific date mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**61. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, the specific fact about bilirubin not improving despite PTBD exchange leading to hospice transition is partially but not completely mentioned in the exact way described. The summary does indicate: 1. Persistent hyperbilirubinemia is noted (\\'total bilirubin remained elevated\\' and \\'Elevated bilirubin levels\\' are mentioned) 2. PTBD exchange was performed (mentioned in interventions and surgical history) 3. Transition to hospice is documented (there\\'s an entire section on \\'Hospice Care Transition\\' with arrangements being made) However, the direct causal relationship between failed bilirubin improvement despite PTBD and the decision to pursue hospice is not explicitly stated. While both elements are present, they are discussed separately and the direct connection between treatment failure and the hospice decision is not clearly documented. The summary does not explicitly state that the family opted for hospice specifically because of the failed bilirubin improvement.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course explicitly states that despite PTBD exchange, total bilirubin remained elevated (\\'Persistent Hyperbilirubinemia\\' section). However, while the summary mentions transitioning to hospice care and family discussions about hospice, it does not specifically state \\'home hospice\\'—the discharge plan refers to hospice care generally. Since the fact requires both components (bilirubin not improving post PTBD and home hospice transition), and \\'home hospice\\' is not explicitly mentioned (only \\'hospice care\\'), the second part of the fact is not fully met. A busy physician might consider hospice care equivalent, but the specific \\'home\\' designation is absent.\\n\\n\\n\\n**62. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, the specific fact about sepsis, delirium, and urinary retention is not explicitly mentioned. Let\\'s break down the analysis: 1. Sepsis requiring antibiotics and fluid resuscitation: While the summary mentions antibiotics (piperacillin tazobactam) and IV fluids for dehydration/hypotension, sepsis is never explicitly diagnosed or mentioned The presence of elevated WBC is noted, but not linked to sepsis 2. Delirium requiring pharmacotherapy: No mention of delirium or confusion anywhere in the summary Patient is described as \\'alert, cooperative, oriented\\' 3. Urinary retention requiring catheter: No mention of urinary retention or urinary catheter placement While I/O monitoring is mentioned under dehydration, there\\'s no indication of urinary issues While the patient had several complications (hyperbilirubinemia, dehydration, hypotension, poor oral intake), none of the three specific complications mentioned in the fact (sepsis, delirium, urinary retention) are explicitly documented in this summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s admission for biliary obstruction and weakness, with a history of distal cholangiocarcinoma. The summary outlines several key issues, including persistent hyperbilirubinemia, dehydration, hypotension, poor oral intake, and right shoulder pain. It mentions the administration of IV fluids for dehydration and hypotension, and the use of antibiotics (piperacillin tazobactam). However, it does not explicitly state that the hospital course was complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation. While the patient was treated with IV fluids and antibiotics, the specific diagnosis of sepsis is not mentioned. The summary does mention delirium indirectly by listing mirtazapine (used for appetite and sometimes for delirium/agitation) among the medications, but it does not explicitly state that delirium was present or required pharmacotherapy. There is no mention of urinary retention or the use of a urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis: The summary mentions administration of piperacillin tazobactam (antibiotics) and IV fluids for dehydration/hypotension, but does not explicitly state sepsis as a complication. While antibiotics and fluids are used in sepsis management, the absence of the term \\'sepsis\\' or clear indicators like SIRS criteria makes this non explicit. 2. Delirium: No mention of delirium or any pharmacotherapy for delirium (e.g., antipsychotics) in the entire summary. The patient is described as \\'alert, cooperative, oriented\\' in physical exam. 3. Urinary retention: No reference to urinary retention or urinary catheter placement. The only catheter mentioned is the biliary drain (PTBD). None of the three components of the fact are explicitly stated in the summary, though some elements (antibiotics/fluids) are present for other indications.\\n\\n\\n\\n**63. Patient 29, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt w/ metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma admitted for dysphagia and weight loss treated w/ PEG and tube feeding and strict NPO.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details a patient with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma admitted for failure to thrive (FTT) and significant weight loss, accompanied by dysphagia. The summary explicitly mentions the patient\\'s dysphagia and weight loss, and the treatment involved NPO status, initiation of parenteral nutrition (PPN), and eventual placement of a G tube for enteral feeding. The discharge plan includes continuing G tube feeding at home and reassessing for potential PEG placement. The fact \\'Pt w/ metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma admitted for dysphagia and weight loss treated w/ PEG and tube feeding and strict NPO\\' is partially mentioned throughout the summary. However, the specific treatment mentioned involves \\'G tube\\' rather than \\'PEG\\' initially, though there\\'s a mention of reassessing for potential PEG placement. The summary does confirm the patient was treated with strict NPO status, tube feeding (via G tube), and there\\'s a plan for potential PEG, aligning with the fact in question.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Check for metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma: The summary mentions \\'nasopharyngeal carcinoma (T4)\\' but does not explicitly state metastasis. T4 refers to local invasion, not distant metastasis. 2. Admission reasons: Dysphagia and weight loss are clearly stated as admission reasons. 3. Treatment with PEG: The summary specifies G tube placement (a type of feeding tube) but mentions PEG only as a future consideration in discharge planning, not as part of treatment. 4. Tube feeding and NPO: Both are explicitly mentioned (G tube feeding and strict NPO status). Since two critical components (metastatic status and PEG use) are not explicitly stated, the exact fact is not fully present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**64. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary carefully, there is no explicit mention that management of the patient\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was deferred to an outpatient oncologist based on the son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium. While the summary does mention: 1. The patient has nasopharyngeal carcinoma 2. The patient has delirium 3. Cancer workup and treatment evaluation are ongoing (PET/CT and MRI pending) 4. Treatment decisions regarding radiation therapy are pending However, it does not specifically state that management was deferred to outpatient care, nor does it mention the son\\'s involvement in this decision making process. The closest reference is in Problem #2 where future cancer treatment is discussed, but the specific deferral to outpatient management is not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s management plan for various issues, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Under \\'Problem #2: Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (T4)\\', it is mentioned that the patient is undergoing cancer treatment evaluation and that decisions regarding radiation therapy are pending. However, there is no explicit mention that the management of the patient\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was deferred to an outpatient oncologist per the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and the patient\\'s delirium. The summary does mention the patient\\'s delirium and the involvement of the patient\\'s son is not explicitly stated in the decision making process for cancer management. Thus, the specific fact about deferring management to an outpatient oncologist due to the son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium is not clearly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed Problem #2 (Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma) section: Mentions cancer workup continuation and radiation consideration, but no reference to deferring management to outpatient oncologist. 2. Checked Delirium section (Problem #3): Documents delirium improvement but no linkage to oncology decision making. 3. Scanned Discharge Plan/Summary: References follow up care for cancer treatment generally, but no explicit statement about deferring management decisions. 4. No mention of patient\\'s son\\'s involvement in care decisions anywhere in the document. 5. While both \\'nasopharyngeal carcinoma\\' and \\'delirium\\' are present, the critical elements of deferral to outpatient oncologist and family directed decision making are absent.\\n\\n\\n\\n**65. Patient 29, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The hospital course summary does mention aspects of both oxygen requirement and aspiration, but not in the specific way described in the fact. Let\\'s break it down: 1. Under \\'Problem #4: Aspiration Risk\\', the summary mentions: Use of humidified high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) CXR showing signs of aspiration Patient being made NPO 2. However, the summary does not explicitly state that: The oxygen requirement was temporary The oxygen requirement was specifically caused by aspiration pneumonitis The NPO status was specifically ordered by SLP (Speech Language Pathology) 3. While aspiration and oxygen support are mentioned, the specific causal relationship and temporary nature described in the fact are not explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n### B.

All Inconsistent Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 0, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left-sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states a left sided abdominal JP drain was left at discharge. 2. The Hospital Course Summary\\'s Discharge Plan and Goals for Problem #1 lists \\'continue pain management, advance diet, complete octreotide, early ambulation\\' but does not mention JP drain management. 3. The Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section specifically arranges for a walker delivery but contains no reference to JP drain care or presence. 4. No other sections (Therapeutic Procedures, Current Status) mention a JP drain. Absence of documentation about drain placement/management at discharge directly contradicts the stated fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 1, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypoxia 2/2 recurrent R pleura effusion\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states hypoxia due to recurrent right pleural effusion. 2. The Hospital Course Summary lists two active problems (SBO and cholangiocarcinoma) but contains no mention of pleural effusion, hypoxia, or any related interventions (e.g., thoracentesis, chest imaging). 3. All diagnostic tests referenced (CT abdomen/pelvis, cancer monitoring) focus on abdominal pathology. 4. No respiratory issues or pleural findings are documented in current status, therapies, or follow up plans.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 1, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** R chest tube was placed with drainage; intrapleural alteplase given; chest tube removed\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states a R chest tube was placed with drainage, intrapleural alteplase given, and chest tube removed. 2. The Hospital Course Summary details SBO management (NGT decompression) and cholangiocarcinoma follow up. 3. No mention of chest tube placement/removal, pleural interventions, or alteplase administration appears in any section (Therapeutic Procedures, Outstanding Issues, or History). 4. These procedures would be documented in therapeutic procedures or problem lists if performed during admission. 5. Absence of documentation directly contradicts the stated fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 1, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** TSH suggested hypothyroidism; synthroid was started\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states hypothyroidism was suggested by TSH and Synthroid was started. 2. The Hospital Course Summary does not mention hypothyroidism, TSH levels, or Synthroid initiation in any section (Problems, Therapies, Discharge Plan, or Medications). 3. Absence of documentation about thyroid management in a detailed discharge summary where medications are typically listed creates a contradiction with the stated fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 2, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed. Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary indicates that laparoscopic small bowel resection is \\'planned\\' but has not yet occurred (Problem #1) 2. The summary mentions \\'awaiting surgical decision\\' as an outstanding issue 3. The Important Fact describes completed surgical procedures (adhesions taken down, mass removed, bowel resection performed) 4. The current clinical status in the summary shows the patient is still dealing with the mass and associated symptoms 5. These details clearly show the surgery described in the Important Fact has not yet taken place according to the summary\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed, and small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed. The Hospital Course Summary under Problem #1 mentions \\'General surgery consultation for small bowel mass; laparoscopic small bowel resection (possible open) planned.\\' It does not confirm that the small bowel resection with primary anastomosis has been performed; instead, it indicates that it was planned. The Current Clinical Status under Problem #1 also mentions \\'no signs of bowel obstruction\\', which contradicts the presence of an \\'obstructing necrotic mass\\' as stated in the Important Fact. Therefore, the Hospital Course Summary does not confirm the surgical procedures described in the Important Fact, indicating a contradiction.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\' and adhesions/necrotic mass addressed. 2. Hospital Summary under Problem #1 states \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection (possible open) planned\\' and \\'surgical oncology consultation for potential resection\\' pending. 3. The summary describes the procedure as planned/future action while the fact presents it as completed, creating direct contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 2, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient recovered from surgery well; had flatus and bowel movement \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states patient is \\'NPO\\' (nothing by mouth) in multiple places (Problem #1 and #13) 2. The summary mentions \\'persistent nausea/vomiting\\' and no indication of bowel movements 3. The Important Fact claims patient had flatus and bowel movement 4. These statements directly contradict each other as a patient on NPO status with persistent nausea/vomiting would not be having normal bowel movements\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient recovered from surgery well and had flatus and bowel movement. The Hospital Course Summary under Problem #1 indicates the patient is \\'NPO\\' (nil per os, meaning nothing by mouth) and has \\'persistent nausea/vomiting\\', which contradicts the idea of having a bowel movement. Under Problem #11: Gastrointestinal (GI) Status, it is mentioned that the patient is \\'tolerating PS1 diet\\', but this does not directly confirm a bowel movement. The presence of \\'persistent nausea/vomiting\\' and being \\'NPO\\' suggests that the patient\\'s recovery and gastrointestinal status as described in the summary is not consistent with having had a bowel movement as stated in the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states patient \\'recovered from surgery well; had flatus and bowel movement.\\' 2. Hospital summary under Problem #1 lists \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection (possible open) planned\\' (not yet performed). 3. Summary explicitly states \\'Continue NPO\\' (Problem #1 discharge plan) and \\'tolerating PS1 diet\\' (Problem #13) but no documentation of completed surgery or post operative bowel function. 4. Bowel regimen medications (Problem #11) suggest proactive management, not confirmation of recovery. These elements conflict with the fact\\'s assertion that surgery recovery with bowel function occurred.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 3, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** LLQ abdominal pain 2/2 cancer\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states LLQ abdominal pain is due to cancer (2/2 cancer). 2. Hospital Summary attributes recurrent LLQ pain to \\'possibly IBS like symptoms\\' rather than cancer progression. 3. This creates a direct contradiction in etiology (cancer vs IBS).\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 4, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions that the patient had urinary retention and underwent Foley catheter placement. It also states that the patient has a history of CKD IV. The Important Fact states \\'AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement.\\' The summary indicates \\'stable kidney function\\' from blood tests, which contradicts the notion of AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) as AKI implies a change or worsening in kidney function. Thus, the summary is inconsistent with the Important Fact because it suggests stable kidney function, whereas AKI on CKD implies an acute deterioration.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states AKI on CKD due to urinary retention treated with foley. 2. Hospital summary explicitly states \\'blood tests indicated stable kidney function\\' in Key Diagnostic Investigations. 3. AKI implies acute deterioration of renal function, which directly conflicts with documented stable kidney function. 4. While foley was placed for urinary retention, the summary contains no evidence of AKI development.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states the patient was transitioned from insulin glargine (Lantus) to insulin lispro, not to Lantus 15 units twice daily 2. Specifically, under Problem #2 (T1DM), it mentions \\'Transition from insulin glargine to subcutaneous insulin lispro\\' 3. This directly contradicts the Important Fact which states insulin was changed to lantus 15 units twice a day\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions that the patient was transitioned from \\'insulin glargine to subcutaneous insulin lispro\\' under Problem #2: Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Insulin glargine is another name for Lantus. The Important Fact states that insulin was changed to Lantus 15 units twice a day. The summary indicates a change from Lantus, contradicting the fact that it was changed to Lantus.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states insulin was changed to Lantus (insulin glargine) 15 units twice daily. 2. Hospital Summary for T1DM states \\'Transition from insulin glargine to subcutaneous insulin lispro\\'. 3. Insulin glargine (Lantus) and insulin lispro are different insulin types (long acting vs rapid acting). 4. Summary explicitly documents a transition away from glargine, directly contradicting the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 6, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Vitamin D deficiency, started on replacement, fat soluble vitamins sent, need to follow-up \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states Vitamin D deficiency was addressed with replacement and fat soluble vitamins sent. 2. The Hospital Course Summary mentions \\'follow up on malabsorption workup, vitamin deficiencies\\' under Outstanding/Pending Issues but does not document initiation of Vitamin D replacement or administration of fat soluble vitamins. 3. The absence of these actions in the summary directly conflicts with the fact that they were performed, creating a contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 7, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left renal cell carcinoma status-post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post-op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\' for renal cell carcinoma. 2. Hospital Summary under Problem #1 lists \\'Left nephrectomy with tumor thrombectomy\\' but never mentions neoadjuvant chemotherapy in \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' or elsewhere. 3. Omission of this critical pretreatment directly contradicts the fact\\'s assertion that chemotherapy occurred preoperatively.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 7, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Continued on apixaban post-op\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'Continued on apixaban post op.\\' 2. Summary under Problem #1\\'s Outstanding/Pending Issues specifies \\'restart home apixaban for DVT prevention.\\' 3. \\'Restart\\' implies discontinuation and re initiation, conflicting with \\'continued\\' (no interruption). 4. Summary\\'s discharge plan for Problem #6 also states \\'Continue home Eliquis,\\' but this doesn\\'t resolve the contradiction in Problem #1\\'s directive to restart.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 8, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Down\\'s syndrome, neurogenic bladder, admitted for pneumonia, treated with CAP regimen and vancomycin due to positive sputum culture for MRSA\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states sputum culture was positive for MRSA. 2. Summary reports sputum culture positive for Staph aureus without specifying MRSA. 3. Summary lists pending MRSA nares PCR, indicating MRSA status was not confirmed from sputum. 4. Use of vancomycin suggests empiric coverage, but does not confirm MRSA in sputum. 5. Direct contradiction between confirmed MRSA (Fact) vs unspecified Staph aureus (Summary).\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact mentions a potential aspiration event and 1/4 bottles positive for GPC with incomplete speciation at discharge. 2. The summary states the sputum culture was positive for Staph aureus (a GPC), which implies speciation was completed, conflicting with \\'speciation not complete\\' in the fact. 3. The summary does not mention aspiration events, but this omission alone does not create a contradiction. The conflict arises from the completed speciation (Staph aureus) vs. the fact\\'s claim of incomplete speciation.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary indicates patient is on Zosyn and awaiting sensitivities, while the fact states patient is completing Cipro 2. Summary shows active treatment with pending antibiotic adjustment, while fact indicates a defined 7 day Cipro course 3. Both mention finasteride initiation for UTI prevention/prostatomegaly, which is consistent 4. Both mention urinary source infection with possible pyelonephritis, which is consistent 5. The different antibiotic regimens (Zosyn vs. Cipro) represent a clear contradiction\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient was finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge for sepsis from a urinary source with potential pyelonephritis and was started on finasteride to prevent future UTIs. The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient was treated for Complicated Urinary Tract Infection with possible developing pyelonephritis and was administered Zosyn, not cipro, pending sensitivities. The summary also confirms that finasteride was started, but for prostatomegaly, which aligns with the Important Fact\\'s mention of starting finasteride. The discrepancy lies in the antibiotic used: Zosyn in the summary versus cipro in the Important Fact. Since both statements cannot be true regarding the antibiotic (cipro vs. Zosyn), this indicates a contradiction.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states patient was \\'finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge\\' and started on finasteride for UTI prevention. 2. Hospital Course Summary documents Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam) administration with plans to \\'await sensitivities and de escalate antibiotics\\' no mention of cipro use. 3. Finasteride is explicitly stated to be for prostatomegaly management, not UTI prevention. 4. These discrepancies (antibiotic choice mismatch and finasteride indication conflict) create irreconcilable contradictions.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 10, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** The patient also was found to have cirrhosis of the liver but has compensated disease \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the patient has cirrhosis of the liver (compensated). 2. The Hospital Course Summary lists \\'alcohol dependence\\' and \\'mild liver enzyme elevations\\' but does not mention cirrhosis in the medical history, problem list, or diagnostic findings. 3. A left hemi hepatectomy (surgical history) is documented, but this does not confirm cirrhosis. 4. Absence of explicit cirrhosis documentation in the summary directly conflicts with the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 11, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient was found to have an elevated troponin thought to be related to demand rather than coronary disease\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states \\'Elevated troponin levels likely due to the humerus fracture, but no myocardial injury was detected\\' 2. The Important Fact states troponin elevation was \\'thought to be related to demand\\' 3. While both statements agree there was no primary coronary disease, they differ on the cause of troponin elevation: Summary attributes it to trauma (fracture) Fact attributes it to demand ischemia 4. These are different physiological mechanisms and cannot both be the primary cause\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary describes a bilateral mastectomy performed on 06/21/2023 (consistent with fact) 2. The post operative course shows some complications/challenges: Patient requires ketamine and lidocaine drips for pain control Has coccyx blistering requiring wound care consult Experiencing elevated glucose levels requiring insulin management Multiple outstanding issues including pain management and monitoring for complications 3. This contradicts the fact\\'s statement of an \\'unremarkable post operative course\\'\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states an \\'unremarkable post operative course\\' leading to discharge. 2. The Summary documents multiple post op issues: coccyx blister requiring wound care consult, elevated glucose needing closer monitoring, and ongoing IV pain management (ketamine/lidocaine drips) on POD#2. 3. These complications (wound issue, glycemic control challenges, prolonged IV analgesia) indicate a non routine recovery, contradicting \\'unremarkable\\' post op course.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows worsening of diabetes control during the perioperative period: Notes \\'elevated glucose levels\\' requiring management Documents the need to \\'increase insulin sliding scale\\' States patient is \\'refusing blood sugar testing\\' Lists diabetes management as an outstanding issue requiring closer monitoring 2. These findings directly contradict the fact stating that diabetes was not worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions \\'Elevated glucose levels\\' under Problem #2: Diabetes Mellitus Type 2, indicating that the patient\\'s DM2 was not perfectly controlled during the hospital stay. Additionally, it notes \\'requires closer monitoring\\' and \\'increase insulin sliding scale\\' as part of the discharge plan, suggesting that DM2 management was a concern. This implies that the patient\\'s DM2 was affected perioperatively, contradicting the Important Fact that states \\'It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\'.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states DM2 was not worsened perioperatively. 2. The summary under Problem #2 notes \\'elevated glucose levels, managed with medication, but requires closer monitoring\\' and plans to \\'increase insulin sliding scale\\', indicating suboptimal perioperative glycemic control. 3. Elevated glucose levels requiring intensified management directly contradict the assertion that DM2 was not worsened during the perioperative period.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 14, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bevacizumab was initiated during hospitalization\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The \\'Important Fact\\' states Bevacizumab was initiated during hospitalization. 2. The hospital summary\\'s \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' sections for both problems list dexamethasone and methadone but do not mention Bevacizumab. 3. The discharge plan and medication continuity sections also exclude Bevacizumab. 4. Since Bevacizumab initiation is a significant therapeutic action that would typically be documented in these sections if administered, its absence creates a direct contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary indicates nausea/vomiting was associated with recent ciprofloxacin use for UTI treatment. 2. The gastrointestinal symptoms are presented as a medication side effect rather than viral gastroenteritis. 3. No viral testing or diagnosis is mentioned in the summary. 4. The summary attributes symptoms to medication side effects and focuses on AKI as the main issue. 5. Treatment involved stopping Zosyn and managing medication side effects, not treating viral illness.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The principal diagnosis at discharge is stated as \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' in the Important Fact. 2. The Hospital Course Summary lists \\'Gastrointestinal Symptoms (Nausea/Vomiting)\\' as Problem #2 but attributes it to recent ciprofloxacin use for UTI (not viral etiology). 3. No mention of viral testing (e.g., stool studies, viral PCR) or treatment targeting viral gastroenteritis in the summary. 4. Discharge plans focus on UTI follow up and medication adjustments, not viral infection management. These points conflict with viral gastroenteritis being the principal diagnosis.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 15, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily stopped when the patient initially came to the hospital.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, prednisone) were stopped on admission. 2. Hospital summary\\'s \\'Outstanding/Pending Issues\\' under AKI lists \\'Recheck creatinine and tacrolimus levels\\'. 3. Checking tacrolimus levels implies ongoing use (levels are monitored during therapy). 4. No documentation of immunosuppressant discontinuation in therapeutic procedures or discharge plans. 5. This creates a contradiction: Stopped per fact vs. implied continued use per summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 16, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Currently on high dose dexamethasone and Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that the patient is to \\'Continue IV dexamethasone 4mg BID\\', which indicates the patient is on dexamethasone. However, it does not explicitly mention \\'high dose\\' or \\'Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\'. The dose mentioned (4mg BID) is not typically considered \\'high dose\\' as high dose usually refers to much higher doses (e.g., 40mg or more per day). The summary does not contradict the fact directly but does not support \\'high dose\\' either. It also doesn\\'t mention Bactrim.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states patient is on high dose dexamethasone. 2. Hospital summary specifies IV dexamethasone 4mg BID (8mg/day), which is a moderate dose, not high dose (typically ≥16mg/day for brain metastases). 3. Summary does not mention Bactrim at all, but absence alone isn\\'t a contradiction. 4. Dexamethasone dose discrepancy creates a direct conflict (moderate vs. high dose).\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 17, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Delirium tremens requiring intravenous benzodiazepines and phenobarbital for symptom control\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'Delirium tremens\\' requiring IV benzodiazepines and phenobarbital. 2. The Hospital Summary diagnoses \\'Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome with Perceptual Disturbance\\' (a distinct, less severe diagnosis than delirium tremens). 3. While phenobarbital and IV Ativan (a benzodiazepine) were administered, the summary explicitly avoids using the term \\'delirium tremens\\' and instead documents improvement under CIWA monitoring. 4. These two diagnoses (AWS vs DT) are mutually exclusive in severity classification, making the summary incompatible with the stated fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 18, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma recently complicated by progression to CNS lymphoma\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact mentions \\'Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) complicated by CNS lymphoma progression.\\' 2. The Hospital Summary documents \\'High grade B cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 translocations\\' and \\'leptomeningeal involvement.\\' 3. High grade B cell lymphoma with MYC/BCL2 rearrangements is a distinct entity from DLBCL in current WHO classifications. 4. Leptomeningeal involvement (CNS lymphoma) is explicitly confirmed in the summary, but the primary diagnosis conflicts with DLBCL. 5. These represent two different lymphoma classifications that cannot coexist as described, creating a contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 20, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** HHT with new PE/DVT s/p IVC filter placement as well as changed to fondaparinux\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states patient was \\'changed to fondaparinux\\' for HHT with PE/DVT. 2. Hospital Summary under Problem #2 documents \\'fondaparinux prophylaxis, transition to apixaban\\' and discharge plan specifies \\'continue anticoagulation with apixaban\\'. 3. This indicates a switch from fondaparinux to apixaban, directly contradicting the stated change to fondaparinux.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact mentions \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\'. The Hospital Course Summary under Problem #3: Thrombocytopenia states that the patient\\'s platelet count improved from a nadir of 42 to 82 after prednisone was administered and increased to 100mg daily. There is no mention of a prednisone taper initiation in the summary; instead, it indicates an increase in prednisone dosage. The summary does not indicate worsening thrombocytopenia; it shows improvement.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\'. 2. Hospital summary documents thrombocytopenia IMPROVEMENT (platelets ↑42→82) with PREDNISONE DOSE INCREASE (40mg→100mg). 3. Summary specifies \\'continue prednisone\\' without mention of tapering. 4. Tapering would typically involve dose decrease, which contradicts the documented dose escalation. 5. Worsening thrombocytopenia cannot coexist with documented platelet improvement under increased steroid dosing.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that the patient \\'presented after multiple falls at home, likely due to recurrent falls and gait instability.\\' This indicates that the cause of the falls was investigated and attributed to gait instability. The Important Fact states \\'recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient.\\' The summary suggests that the etiology of the falls was identified as gait instability, contradicting the fact that the etiology remained unknown. Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions a \\'new T6 wedge compression fracture\\' discovered during diagnostic investigations 2. The Important Fact states the T6 fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall\\' 3. These statements directly contradict each other the fracture cannot be both \\'new\\' and pre existing from before the recent fall 4. The summary\\'s characterization of the fracture as \\'new\\' implies it resulted from the recent falls, which conflicts with the Important Fact\\'s timeline\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that diagnostic investigations confirmed a \\'new T6 wedge compression fracture.\\' The Important Fact states that the T6 wedge compression fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall.\\' The summary and the fact cannot both be true because the summary describes the fracture as \\'new,\\' implying it happened recently, while the fact suggests it occurred before the most recent fall. Thus, they are inconsistent.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the T6 fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall.\\' 2. The Hospital Summary describes the T6 fracture as \\'new\\' in diagnostic results. 3. A \\'new\\' fracture implies acute occurrence during/after the recent fall, conflicting with the pre existing nature suggested by the fact. 4. No mention of chronicity or prior imaging supporting an older fracture in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states to \\'continue and re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion.\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary for Problem #5 (Infection/Sepsis) specifies \\'Continue empiric Zosyn\\' and \\'Continue antibiotic therapy\\' without mentioning Augmentin. 3. Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) and Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate) are distinct antibiotics. 4. The summary\\'s explicit use of Zosyn directly conflicts with the Important Fact\\'s Augmentin related instruction, as both cannot be true simultaneously.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 22, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** patient should follow up with Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/ Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Poultsides, George, MD in in 2 weeks\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact specifies follow up with an APP in 1 week and Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. 2. The Hospital Course Summary\\'s \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists multiple follow up actions (radiation oncology, dietitian, diabetes management, etc.) but does not mention APP or Dr. Poultsides. 3. Omission of these specific providers in the summary creates a direct contradiction, as both documents cannot simultaneously represent accurate discharge instructions.\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 24, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states patient is on \\'NPO status with NGT in place\\' 2. The discharge plan mentions \\'Continue NGT decompression\\' and \\'start full liquids\\' 3. These indicate the patient is still requiring NGT and has not yet advanced to full liquid diet 4. The fact states patient was \\'discharged on full liquid diet\\', implying NGT was removed 5. The summary shows active NGT use which contradicts being on oral diet at discharge\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 26, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Metoprolol dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily for improved rate control; Apixaban dosage increased to 5 mg twice daily for anticoagulation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states apixaban dosage was increased to 5 mg BID. 2. Hospital Summary under Problem #3 specifies \\'Continued home apixaban for VTE prophylaxis\\' with no dosage change mentioned. 3. \\'Continued\\' implies no dosage adjustment, conflicting with the fact\\'s explicit dosage increase.\\n\\n\\n\\n**34. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states emesis may be related to SMA stenosis (chronic mesenteric ischemia). 2. Hospital Summary attributes vomiting to gastroparesis/hypovolemia and lists SMA stenosis only as a diagnostic finding without linking it to emesis. 3. No acknowledgment of mesenteric ischemia as a potential cause creates a conflict between the two statements.\\n\\n\\n\\n**35. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states the patient was found to have \\'coagulase negative strep bacteremia\\', while the Hospital Course Summary indicates \\'Coag Negative Staph bacteremia\\' (specifically, with mecA gene detected). Coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) and coagulase negative Streptococcus are different bacteria; thus, the type of bacteremia mentioned in the Important Fact and the Hospital Course Summary are not the same.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states bacteremia was due to \\'coagulase negative strep\\', but Hospital Summary specifies \\'Coag Negative Staph bacteremia. 2. \\'Staph\\' (Staphylococcus) and \\'Strep\\' (Streptococcus) are distinct bacterial genera; they cannot both be correct. 3. Summary explicitly mentions mecA gene (associated with Staph) and Vancomycin use (anti staphylococcal therapy). 4. This represents a direct microbiological contradiction between the fact and documented pathogens.\\n\\n\\n\\n**36. Patient 27, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The important fact states patient had tonsillitis treated with antibiotics 2. The hospital summary mentions \\'mildly enlarged tonsils\\' on CT maxillofacial, but: No diagnosis of tonsillitis is made Antibiotics given were for bacteremia, not tonsillitis Main oral issues noted were thrush and dental caries Oral treatments were fluconazole and nystatin for thrush 3. The clinical picture and treatment course described is inconsistent with tonsillitis being a primary diagnosis or reason for antibiotic treatment\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient had mildly enlarged tonsils on CT maxillofacial, but it does not confirm tonsillitis. The summary states \\'Oral thrush treated with fluconazole and nystatin, dental caries noted\\' under Therapeutic Procedures Performed for Oral Health Issues, suggesting that the oral issue was identified as thrush rather than tonsillitis. The Important Fact mentions \\'Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics,\\' which is not supported by the summary. The summary does not mention treating tonsillitis with antibiotics; instead, it mentions treating thrush and addressing dental caries. Thus, the summary does not confirm the presence of tonsillitis or its treatment with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\' 2. Hospital Summary\\'s CT showed \\'mildly enlarged tonsils\\' but attributed oral issues to thrush (treated with antifungals) and dental caries. 3. Antibiotics (Zosyn/Vancomycin) were used for bacteremia, not tonsilitis. 4. No documentation of tonsillitis diagnosis or targeted antibiotic treatment for tonsils in summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**37. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary does not mention sepsis it only mentions antibiotics (piperacillin tazobactam) without stating sepsis as the indication 2. While dehydration and hypotension are mentioned with fluid treatment, it\\'s not specifically described as \\'aggressive fluid resuscitation\\' 3. No mention of delirium or need for pharmacotherapy for delirium 4. No mention of urinary retention or need for urinary catheter 5. The clinical course described in the summary appears significantly different from the complications stated in the Important Fact\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact mentions sepsis requiring antibiotics and fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring catheter. 2. The summary lists piperacillin tazobactam (antibiotics) and IV fluids, but attributes them to dehydration/hypotension management, not sepsis. 3. No mention of delirium or psychotropic medications for delirium in the summary. 4. Urinary retention and catheter use are absent from the summary\\'s issues, interventions, or discharge plans. 5. The three key complications in the Important Fact are either absent or attributed to different causes in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**38. Patient 29, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt w/ metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma admitted for dysphagia and weight loss treated w/ PEG and tube feeding and strict NPO.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states the patient was treated with PEG and tube feeding. 2. Hospital Summary mentions G tube placement (not PEG) and plans to \\'re evaluate for potential PEG placement\\' post discharge. 3. These are conflicting as PEG is a type of G tube placement method; the summary indicates PEG was not yet performed, contradicting the fact\\'s claim that it was used during treatment.\\n\\n\\n\\n**39. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows active cancer workup and treatment planning: \\'PET/CT and MRI expedited workup ordered\\' and \\'decisions regarding radiation therapy\\' pending 2. There is no mention of deferring cancer management to outpatient oncology 3. While the summary mentions patient\\'s delirium and documents his son\\'s involvement, it does not indicate that cancer management was deferred due to these factors 4. The summary actually suggests ongoing inpatient cancer management with pending diagnostic tests and treatment planning\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma was deferred to outpatient oncologist due to son\\'s wishes and delirium. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s Problem #2 discharge plan states \\'continue cancer workup, consider radiation therapy\\' with no mention of deferral. 3. Summary\\'s \\'Outstanding Issues\\' lists pending decisions about radiation therapy, indicating active inpatient planning rather than deferral. 4. Delirium is noted as improved in the hospital course, but no documentation links this to deferral of cancer management. These points create direct conflict between planned inpatient management (summary) and reported deferral (fact).\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Presence of important facts\\n\\n**Score: 60/100** (95% CI: 50-70) (higher values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the important facts missing:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries frequently omit critical clinical details due to several recurring patterns: (1) **Procedural/Operative Simplification** - key surgical steps (e.g., Patient 2’s adhesiolysis, Patient 7’s missing neoadjuvant chemotherapy) are excluded despite documenting related procedures. (2) **Implied vs Explicit Documentation** - post-operative milestones (Patient 2’s bowel function) or diagnoses (Patient 4’s AKI on CKD) are inferred from context but not explicitly stated. (3) **Medication/Treatment Specificity Gaps** - insulin type/dose discrepancies (Patient 6’s Lantus vs Levemir), antibiotic rationale (Patient 8’s vancomycin indication), or therapy duration (Patient 9’s absent 7-day Cipro course) lack precision. (4) **Diagnostic Linkage Failures** - imaging/lab findings (Patient 26’s SMA stenosis, Patient 19’s hydronephrosis-UTI relationship) aren’t connected to clinical implications. (5) **Follow-Up Ambiguity** - discharge instructions omit specifics like CBC frequency (Patient 20) or appointment timelines (Patient 22). Additionally, temporal inaccuracies (Patient 28’s PTBD exchange date) and incomplete problem lists (Patient 15’s missing viral gastroenteritis diagnosis) further illustrate systemic omissions where critical details are either fragmented across sections or replaced by generalized terminology.\\n\\n### B. Hospital course summaries contradicting important facts\\n\\n**Score: 16/100** (95% CI: 10-24) (lower values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the inconsistencies:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries frequently exhibit inconsistencies with clinical facts due to recurring patterns: **medication/treatment discrepancies** (Patient 6: Lantus 15u BID vs. Levemir 16u BID), **contradictory diagnostic interpretations** (Patient 26: SMA stenosis attributed to chronic ischemia vs. gastritis in the summary), **omission or misrepresentation of clinical events** (Patient 8: unreported GPC-positive cultures vs. \"no growth\" in the summary; Patient 28: missing urinary retention documentation), **conflicting lab/diagnostic timelines** (Patient 20: speciation reported as incomplete vs. identified *Staph aureus*), **misclassification of clinical course severity** (Patient 13: \"unremarkable\" post-op vs. documented hypertension, hyperglycemia, and pain interventions), and **timing errors** (Patient 21: \"new\" T6 fracture vs. pre-existing; Patient 28: PTBD exchange date mismatch [4/8 vs. 4/21]). Additionally, **antibiotic/treatment contradictions** (Patient 9: cipro vs. Zosyn; Patient 27: antifungals vs. antibiotics for tonsillitis) and **misaligned principal diagnoses** (Patient 15: viral gastroenteritis vs. ATN) highlight systemic documentation inaccuracies. These patterns often arise from transcription errors, incomplete data reconciliation, or divergent clinical interpretations of the same findings.\\n\\n## Detailed results\\n\\n### A.

All Missing Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 2, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed. Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, while it mentions that a laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed (mentioned in both the Surgical History and Therapeutic Procedures sections), it does not explicitly state that adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down or that an obstructing necrotic mass was removed during the procedure. While we know there was a necrotic small bowel mass (mentioned in the Reason for Admission and Primary Diagnosis), the specific surgical details about taking down adhesions and removing the obstructing mass are not explicitly described in the summary. The summary only provides the general procedure name without these specific intraoperative details.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' under Therapeutic Procedures Performed and references the \\'necrotic small bowel mass\\' requiring resection. However, there is no mention of adhesions between the omentum and abdominal wall being taken down. While the removal of the obstructing necrotic mass is clearly stated, the specific detail about adhesiolysis is absent. The resection and mass removal components are documented, but the adhesion takedown is not explicitly described, even when accounting for clinical synonyms or abbreviations.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 2, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient recovered from surgery well; had flatus and bowel movement \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, while the summary mentions that the patient is \\'tolerating oral intake\\' and had a \\'stable post operative course,\\' it does not explicitly state whether the patient had flatus or bowel movements. Even though these are important post operative milestones that are typically monitored, they are not specifically documented in either the standard section based summary or the problem based summary. The closest relevant information is the mention of \\'tolerating diet advancement\\' under Problem #1, but this does not definitively indicate passage of flatus or bowel movements.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary indicates that the patient \\'Tolerating oral intake\\' and had a \\'Stable post operative course\\' after undergoing laparoscopic small bowel resection. While it does not directly state \\'had flatus and bowel movement,\\' the fact that the patient is tolerating diet advancement and has a stable post operative course suggests recovery from surgery. However, the specific details about flatus and bowel movement are not explicitly mentioned in the provided summaries.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed in both standard and problem based formats. While the summary mentions \\'tolerating oral intake\\' and \\'diet advancement\\' (Problem #1), and describes the post operative course as \\'uncomplicated\\' and \\'stable,\\' there is no explicit documentation of flatus or bowel movement. These terms are clinical indicators of return of bowel function but are not directly stated. The summary focuses on hemodynamic stability, surgical healing, and oral intake tolerance without specifying bowel function milestones.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 4, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Analyzing the summary step by step: 1. The summary mentions CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease Stage IV) in both formats 2. There is urinary retention explicitly mentioned as a primary reason for admission 3. The summary documents treatment with Foley catheter placement 4. However, while both CKD and urinary retention with Foley placement are mentioned, the summary does not explicitly state that the patient developed AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) on top of their CKD 5. The creatinine value of 3.64 is mentioned, but there\\'s no indication whether this represents an acute change from baseline 6. The summary does not specifically link the urinary retention to any worsening of kidney function 7. Therefore, while components of the fact are present (CKD, urinary retention, Foley placement), the specific concept of AKI on CKD is not explicitly mentioned\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly mentions \\'Chronic Kidney Disease Stage IV\\' in the medical history. 2. Urinary retention is clearly stated as the primary reason for admission and diagnosis. 3. Foley catheter placement is documented as a therapeutic procedure. 4. However, the summary does not explicitly mention \\'AKI\\' (Acute Kidney Injury) or any equivalent term. While elevated creatinine (3.64) is noted, this is presented as part of lab results without being framed as an acute worsening of renal function. 5. The CKD is described as \\'stable at baseline\\' in the problem based summary, further suggesting no acute component was diagnosed. 6. Though urinary retention could theoretically cause AKI on CKD, the text never connects these elements explicitly.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, while adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune polyglandular syndrome is clearly documented, there is no explicit mention that the crisis was likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. The summary shows: 1. Clear documentation of adrenal crisis (mentioned in Reason for Admission and Primary Diagnosis) 2. Clear documentation of Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2 (listed in medical history) 3. Primary Adrenal Insufficiency is documented (diagnosed 01/2022) However, nowhere in the summary is there any mention of: PO prednisone use prior to admission Intolerance to PO prednisone PO prednisone as a contributing factor to the crisis The treatment course shows transition from IV hydrocortisone to PO hydrocortisone, but does not mention any previous prednisone therapy or issues with it.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient had an adrenal crisis in the setting of Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2 and primary adrenal insufficiency. However, there is no mention of prednisone intolerance as a contributing factor. The summary documents hydrocortisone use (tapered from IV to PO) and fludrocortisone, but does not reference prednisone therapy, discontinuation, or intolerance. While the autoimmune etiology and adrenal crisis are clearly stated, the specific claim of prednisone intolerance as a cause for the crisis is absent from the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary carefully, while Type 1 diabetes is mentioned multiple times and insulin management is discussed, the specific fact about insulin being changed to Lantus 15 units twice daily is not explicitly stated. The summary instead mentions \\'Levemir 16 units BID\\' as the insulin regimen (seen in both Format 1 Section 8: Medications and Format 2 Problem #3). This is a different long acting insulin with a different dosing than what we\\'re looking for. While insulin changes are referenced (\\'Transition from insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin\\'), the specific change to Lantus 15 units twice daily is not mentioned anywhere in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary is analyzed in two formats: Standard Section Based Summary and Problem Based Summary. In the Standard Section Based Summary, under section 8 \\'Medications: Started/Modified:\\', it is mentioned that \\'Levemir 16 units BID\\' was prescribed. Although the summary does not explicitly state \\'insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day,\\' it does mention a change to subcutaneous insulin (in section 7 \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\') and specifies \\'Levemir 16 units BID\\' in section 8. Levemir is a type of long acting insulin, similar to Lantus. The dose is 16 units twice a day, which is close to but not exactly 15 units twice a day. In the Problem Based Summary, under \\'Problem #3: Type 1 Diabetes Management,\\' it is confirmed that the patient was discharged on \\'Levemir 16 units BID.\\' While the fact is not mentioned verbatim, the information about the insulin regimen is present, indicating a change to a long acting insulin (Levemir) at discharge, though the exact dose and type (Lantus vs. Levemir) differ slightly.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'Levemir 16 units BID\\' under Medications and in the Type 1 Diabetes Management problem. While Levemir (insulin detemir) and Lantus (insulin glargine) are both long acting insulins, they are distinct formulations. The summary specifies Levemir rather than Lantus, and the dose is 16 units BID rather than 15 units. Since the fact requires both the specific insulin type (Lantus) and dose (15 units BID), neither of which are present in the text, the exact fact is not mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 7, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left renal cell carcinoma status-post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post-op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact about left renal cell carcinoma with IVC thrombectomy is explicitly mentioned multiple times in the summary, but there is no mention of neoadjuvant chemotherapy anywhere in the text. The summary clearly documents: 1. The primary diagnosis as \\'Left renal cell carcinoma with tumor thrombus extending into left renal vein and IVC\\' 2. The surgical procedure performed as \\'Left radical nephrectomy\\' and \\'IVC thrombectomy\\' 3. This is mentioned in both Format 1 (Reason for Admission and Primary Diagnosis sections) and Format 2 (Problem #1) However, while the post operative status and surgical intervention are clearly documented, there is no mention of any neoadjuvant chemotherapy being given prior to surgery. Therefore, while most of the fact is present, the neoadjuvant chemotherapy component is missing, making this not a complete match.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Left renal cell carcinoma status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. The summary is given in two formats: Standard Section Based Summary and Problem Based Summary. In the Standard Section Based Summary, under \\'Reason for Admission\\' and \\'Primary Diagnosis\\', it is mentioned that the patient had left renal cell carcinoma with tumor thrombus extending into IVC, and underwent left nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy. However, there is no mention of \\'neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\'. The Problem Based Summary also confirms the diagnosis and surgical treatment of left renal cell carcinoma with IVC thrombus but again does not mention neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, while the summary mentions left renal cell carcinoma, left nephrectomy, and IVC thrombectomy, it does not explicitly mention \\'neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\'. Thus, the entire fact as stated is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions the patient underwent left radical nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy for left renal cell carcinoma with IVC tumor thrombus in both the \\'Reason for Admission\\' and \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' sections. However, there is no mention of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in any part of the summary. The absence of references to chemotherapy in the medical history, medications, or treatment timeline indicates this component of the fact is missing. While the surgical components (nephrectomy and thrombectomy) are clearly documented, the neoadjuvant chemotherapy element is not stated or implied. Since the fact requires both components, the absence of chemotherapy documentation leads to the conclusion that the full fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 7, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second-line\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing both the standard section based summary and problem based summary formats, there is no mention of: 1. Any immunotherapy treatment with ipilimumab/nivolumab (ipi/nivo) 2. Any hypersensitivity reaction to these medications 3. Any switch to cabozantinib as second line therapy The summary focuses entirely on the surgical management of renal cell carcinoma through left nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy. While the patient\\'s cancer diagnosis and treatment are discussed, there is no reference to any systemic therapy (immunotherapy or targeted therapy). The complications mentioned are all surgery related (hypotension, delirium, anemia) rather than treatment related hypersensitivity reactions.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second line\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. The summary is presented in two formats: a standard section based summary and a problem based summary. Upon reviewing both summaries, there is no mention of \\'Hypersensitivity reaction\\', \\'ipi/nivo\\', or \\'cabozantinib\\' in either format. The section based summary details the patient\\'s admission for left nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy, relevant medical and surgical history, primary and secondary diagnoses, diagnostic investigations, therapeutic procedures, medications, and condition at discharge. The problem based summary outlines the patient\\'s problems and their current status, discharge plans, and outstanding issues. Neither summary contains information related to the specified fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed in both standard and problem based formats. Key sections reviewed included Medications, Therapeutic Procedures, and Problem Lists. There is no mention of ipilimumab/nivolumab (ipi/nivo) therapy, hypersensitivity reactions, or cabozantinib use in any section. The summary focuses on surgical management of renal cell carcinoma and post operative complications, with medications limited to perioperative care (heparin, apixaban, PPIs). No oncologic therapies or treatment changes related to immunotherapy/TKI agents are documented. The absence of these terms or equivalent clinical descriptors in all sections confirms the fact is not mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 8, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Down\\'s syndrome, neurogenic bladder, admitted for pneumonia, treated with CAP regimen and vancomycin due to positive sputum culture for MRSA\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze each component of the fact: 1. Down\\'s syndrome Explicitly mentioned in medical history as \\'Down\\'s syndrome with non verbal baseline\\' 2. Neurogenic bladder Explicitly mentioned in medical history as \\'Neurogenic bladder requiring straight catheterization\\' 3. Admitted for pneumonia Confirmed in multiple places: admission for \\'left lower lobe pneumonia\\', listed as primary diagnosis \\'community acquired pneumonia\\' 4. Treatment with CAP regimen and vancomycin due to positive sputum culture for MRSA This part is partially accurate but not exactly as stated. While the patient received CAP treatment (ceftriaxone and azithromycin) and vancomycin, the vancomycin was added due to positive MRSA nares screen, not due to MRSA in sputum culture. The sputum culture showed \\'Light growth of Staphylococcus aureus\\' but doesn\\'t specifically mention MRSA. Since this specific causality detail is incorrect in the fact statement, we cannot mark this as fully present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Down\\'s syndrome is explicitly listed under Relevant Medical History. 2. Neurogenic bladder is documented in the same section. 3. Admission for pneumonia is confirmed in Reason for Admission and Primary Diagnosis. 4. CAP regimen (ceftriaxone + azithromycin) is clearly stated in Medications. 5. Vancomycin use is noted, but the stated reason is MRSA+ (from nares screen), not sputum culture. While MRSA nares colonization and Staph aureus in sputum are both present, the summary does not explicitly state that vancomycin was added due to MRSA in sputum culture. The causal attribution in the fact (\\'due to positive sputum culture for MRSA\\') is not match the documented rationale (MRSA nares).\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the entire hospital course summary, searching for any mention of: 1) an aspiration event near discharge, 2) blood culture results showing 1/4 bottles positive for GPC (gram positive cocci), and 3) incomplete speciation at discharge. The summary does mention blood cultures, but states they had \\'no growth.\\' There is no mention of any aspiration event prior to discharge, nor any mention of positive blood cultures with GPC or pending speciation. The only positive culture mentioned is a sputum culture showing Staphylococcus aureus and a positive MRSA nares screen. The discharge section describes the patient as clinically improved with normalized inflammatory markers, but does not mention any new aspiration events or pending culture results.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact \\'Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\' is mentioned in the hospital course summary, I will thoroughly examine both the Standard Section Based Summary and the Problem Based Summary. The fact consists of three main components: a potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles being positive for GPC (Gram Positive Cocci), and the speciation not being complete by the time of discharge. Upon reviewing the summaries, there is no explicit mention of a potential aspiration event, the results of blood cultures or other cultures indicating GPC positivity, or any discussion regarding speciation pending at discharge. The summaries detail the patient\\'s admission for pneumonia, treatment course, and discharge status but do not directly or indirectly mention the specified fact. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned in the provided summaries.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\' section: Sputum culture shows light growth of Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA nares positive. No mention of any culture bottles (1/4 positive) or GPC findings. 2. Checked \\'Medications\\' section: Vancomycin was used for MRSA coverage, but no documentation of treatment decisions based on pending GPC speciation. 3. Scanned \\'Outstanding Issues\\' and \\'Discharge Plan\\': While secretion management is noted, there\\'s no reference to a recent aspiration event or incomplete bacterial speciation at discharge. 4. Confirmed absence in all sections: The specific combination of \\'1/4 bottles positive for GPC\\' with pending speciation prior to discharge isn\\'t mentioned in either format of the summary, despite documentation of other microbiology results.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 8, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Neurogenic bladder, high risk of UTI\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact \\'neurogenic bladder, high risk of UTI\\' is partially mentioned in the summary. The neurogenic bladder condition is explicitly stated in two places: 1) Under \\'Relevant Medical History\\' which lists \\'neurogenic bladder requiring straight catheterization\\' and 2) Under \\'Problem #3: Chronic Medical Management\\' which mentions \\'Neurogenic bladder managed with straight catheterization.\\' However, while neurogenic bladder is clearly documented, the specific detail about \\'high risk of UTI\\' is not explicitly stated in the summary. Although it\\'s clinically understood that patients with neurogenic bladder requiring catheterization are at higher risk for UTIs, this specific risk is not directly mentioned in the text. Since we\\'re looking for both components (neurogenic bladder AND high risk of UTI) to be explicitly mentioned, and only one is present, this would be marked as not fully present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** Step 1: Search for \\'neurogenic bladder\\' Found explicitly listed under \\'Relevant Medical History\\' (Section 2). Step 2: Search for \\'high risk of UTI\\' or equivalent No direct mention of UTI risk in any section. While neurogenic bladder and catheterization inherently carry UTI risk, the summary never explicitly states this risk. Step 3: Apply guidelines The explicit combination \\'neurogenic bladder, high risk of UTI\\' is not present. Though neurogenic bladder management is documented, the specific UTI risk statement (or equivalent) is missing. Per guidelines, implied risks without explicit documentation require 0.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Analyzing the hospital course summary step by step: 1. The summary does mention sepsis from a urinary source with pyelonephritis (\"diagnosed with complicated urinary tract infection with developing pyelonephritis and sepsis\") 2. However, there is no mention of Cipro (ciprofloxacin) or a 7 day course instead, the patient was treated with Piperacillin Tazobactam (Zosyn) 3. Finasteride is indeed mentioned as being started (\"Initiated Finasteride 5mg daily for prostatomegaly\") 4. However, the summary does not explicitly state that finasteride was started to prevent future UTIs it states it was started for prostatomegaly 5. While some elements of the fact are present (sepsis from urinary source, pyelonephritis, and finasteride initiation), key specific elements (7 day Cipro course and the stated purpose of finasteride for UTI prevention) are not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, this cannot be considered a complete match.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, treatment, and discharge plan. The patient was diagnosed with a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) with pyelonephritis and sepsis due to Klebsiella pneumoniae. The summary mentions that the patient was treated with Piperacillin Tazobactam and that Finasteride was initiated for prostatomegaly. The summary does not explicitly state that the patient was finishing a 7 day course of Cipro on discharge; instead, it indicates that the patient was to complete an antibiotic course per sensitivities, without specifying the antibiotic. However, it does confirm that the patient was diagnosed with sepsis from a urinary source with potential pyelonephritis and that Finasteride was started in an attempt to manage prostatomegaly, which could help prevent future UTIs.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis: Explicitly stated in the \\'Primary Diagnosis\\' as \\'Complicated UTI with pyelonephritis and sepsis due to Klebsiella pneumoniae\\' and in the \\'Reason for Admission\\' as \\'developing pyelonephritis and sepsis\\'. This matches the first part of the fact. 2. 7 day course of cipro on discharge: The summary specifies \\'extended infusion Piperacillin Tazobactam\\' as the antibiotic used during admission and mentions \\'complete antibiotic course per sensitivities\\' at discharge, but does not explicitly mention ciprofloxacin (cipro) or a 7 day duration. This element is missing. 3. Started on finasteride to prevent UTIs: Finasteride is documented as being initiated for prostatomegaly, not explicitly for UTI prevention. While prostatomegaly management may indirectly reduce UTI risk, the stated purpose in the summary is anatomical management, not UTI prophylaxis. Conclusion: Two of the three key components (cipro use/duration and finasteride indication) are not explicitly stated. While sepsis/pyelonephritis is confirmed, the full fact as defined is not fully present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 9, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling, DVT US negative, unclear etiology \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary step by step looking for mentions of extremity swelling and DVT findings: 1. In Format 1, under \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results,\\' there is mention of \\'DVT ultrasound (upper and lower extremities): Negative\\' 2. However, while the DVT ultrasound result is mentioned, there is no explicit mention of right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling anywhere in the summary 3. The summary does not describe the reason for ordering the DVT ultrasound or any presenting swelling 4. The etiology discussion regarding unclear cause is also not present Therefore, while related information (DVT ultrasound) is present, the specific fact about extremity swelling and its unclear etiology is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling, DVT US negative, unclear etiology\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, it is noted that under section 6 \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\', it is mentioned that \\'DVT ultrasound (upper and lower extremities): Negative\\'. However, there is no mention of swelling in the right upper extremity and left lower extremity. The summary does not explicitly state the swelling or its unclear etiology. Therefore, the specific fact is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'DVT ultrasound (upper and lower extremities): Negative\\' in the Key Diagnostic Investigations section, confirming the DVT US was negative. However, there is no mention of right upper extremity or left lower extremity swelling anywhere in the summary. While the DVT ultrasound result is documented, the clinical indication for the test (swelling in specific extremities) and the unresolved etiology are not stated. The absence of explicit documentation about the swelling itself and its unclear cause means the full fact is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 12, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was started on empiric antibiotics but was found to have a normal WBC with normal lactate and abx were discontinued, he was not discharged on antibiotics\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find any explicit mention of empiric antibiotics being started and then discontinued due to normal WBC and lactate. While the summary covers various aspects of the patient\\'s care including IV fluid resuscitation, TPN optimization, and medication adjustments, there is no reference to antibiotic administration or discontinuation. The summary discusses lab values in general terms (mentioning anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated triglycerides) but does not specifically mention WBC counts or lactate levels. Additionally, there is no mention of the patient\\'s antibiotic status at discharge.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention that the patient was started on empiric antibiotics, had a normal WBC with normal lactate, and that antibiotics were discontinued. It also doesn\\'t state that the patient was not discharged on antibiotics. The summary covers various aspects of the patient\\'s hospitalization including hemodynamic instability, nutritional status, and functional status, but it does not address antibiotic use or discontinuation directly.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed \\'Medications\\' section: No mention of antibiotics being started or discontinued. Only notes continuation of home meds except Plavix and TPN modifications. 2. Checked \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\': Labs listed (Hgb 8.2, albumin 2.7, triglycerides 297) do not include WBC or lactate values. 3. Scanned \\'Therapeutic Procedures\\' and problem based sections: IV fluids and TPN mentioned, but no reference to antibiotic use. 4. Examined discharge medications/plans: No antibiotics listed in discharge regimen. 5. While patient had fistulas (potential infection source), the summary contains no documentation of empiric antibiotics initiation or discontinuation based on lab results. Conclusion: The specific sequence of antibiotic initiation followed by normal WBC/lactate leading to discontinuation is not documented in any section.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 12, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was discharged on TPN with instructions to follow up in 4 weeks  \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, while TPN is mentioned multiple times (including \\'TPN optimization\\', \\'modified TPN regimen\\', and \\'Cyclic TPN providing 1947 kcal over 18 hours\\'), there is no explicit mention of a 4 week follow up instruction. The discharge information includes details about home health services, TPN through Soleo Health, and equipment needs, but does not specify a 4 week follow up timeline. The conclusion section mentions discharge planning but does not include specific follow up timing. Therefore, while we know the patient was discharged on TPN, we cannot confirm the 4 week follow up instruction was part of the discharge plan.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact \\'He was discharged on TPN with instructions to follow up in 4 weeks\\' is explicitly mentioned, I will analyze the provided Hospital Course Summary in both Standard Section Based and Problem Based formats. The summary indicates that the patient was discharged on a modified TPN regimen, as mentioned in \\'Problem #2: Nutritional Status\\' under \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\'. However, the specific instruction to \\'follow up in 4 weeks\\' is not directly stated in the summary. The closest relevant information is found in \\'Problem #3: Functional Status\\' under \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\', which mentions home health services, and in the \\'Conclusion\\' section, which mentions discharge plans. Despite the lack of explicit mention of \\'follow up in 4 weeks\\', the summary does confirm discharge on TPN.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions the patient was discharged on a modified TPN regimen (under \\'Medications\\' and \\'Nutritional Status\\' sections). However, the specific instruction to \\'follow up in 4 weeks\\' is not mentioned anywhere in the text. While follow up with home health services and TPN monitoring are noted, no explicit 4 week timeframe for follow up is documented. The absence of this temporal specification means the full fact as stated is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly states the patient underwent \\'bilateral mastectomy\\' under \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' and \\'Reason for Admission\\'. 2. The post operative course describes managed complications (pain, hypertension, hyperglycemia) but concludes with \\'appropriate post operative recovery\\' and \\'successfully managed\\' without major adverse events. While not using \\'unremarkable\\', this meets clinical documentation standards for an uneventful recovery. 3. Discharge destination isn\\'t explicitly stated as \\'home\\', though discharge readiness is documented. The combination of \\'ambulatory\\' status and standard discharge planning implies home discharge, but this isn\\'t definitively stated. Since the fact requires explicit mention of discharge home and this isn\\'t directly documented, this component is missing.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 13, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt has significant mental health history including anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder and did have a panic attack while admitted \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the summary for mentions of mental health history and panic attacks. The summary does partially mention mental health history, listing \\'Bipolar disorder, PTSD, depression\\' in the Relevant Medical History section. It also notes psychiatric medications being continued (BuSpar, Seroquel, trazodone). However, while anxiety and borderline personality disorder are part of the fact we\\'re looking for, they are not mentioned in the summary. Additionally, there is no mention of any panic attack occurring during the admission. Since the fact we\\'re looking for specifically includes all these components (anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, AND a panic attack during admission), and several of these elements are missing from the text, this specific fact as a complete unit is not fully present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Pt has significant mental health history including anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder and did have a panic attack while admitted\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. The summary lists the patient\\'s relevant medical history, which includes \\'Bipolar disorder, PTSD, depression\\'. Anxiety and borderline personality disorder are not explicitly mentioned in the medical history section. Furthermore, there is no mention of the patient having a panic attack during the admission. The psychiatric medications continued during the hospital stay include BuSpar, Seroquel, and trazodone, which may be related to the patient\\'s mental health history, but this does not directly confirm the presence of anxiety or borderline personality disorder, nor does it indicate a panic attack occurred. Therefore, the specific fact is not entirely mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Checked \\'Relevant Medical History\\' section: Lists bipolar disorder, PTSD, and depression. Anxiety and borderline personality disorder are not mentioned here. 2. Reviewed psychiatric medications: BuSpar (for anxiety), Seroquel (bipolar), trazodone (depression) are listed, but medications alone don\\'t constitute explicit diagnosis documentation. 3. Scanned entire summary for panic attack mention: No documentation of panic attacks during admission in vital signs monitoring, progress notes, or problem lists. 4. Verified secondary diagnoses and discharge issues: Only labile hypertension and diabetes management are highlighted as acute issues, with no reference to acute psychiatric events. Conclusion: While bipolar and PTSD are documented, anxiety and borderline personality disorder diagnoses are absent, and there\\'s no mention of panic attacks during admission. The fact requires all listed elements to be present, which they are not.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I found evidence that the patient\\'s diabetes (DM2) was actually somewhat worsened during the perioperative period. Specifically, the summary notes \\'Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia (glucose range 139 245 mg/dL)\\' under Secondary Diagnoses, and later mentions \\'Moderate hyperglycemia requiring insulin adjustment\\' under Problem #4. The need for insulin adjustment and the elevated glucose range (normal range is typically 70 140 mg/dL) indicates that the diabetes was indeed affected during the perioperative period. Therefore, the statement that DM2 was not worsened perioperatively is incorrect according to the documented evidence.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing both the standard section based summary and problem based summary formats, I find that viral gastroenteritis is not explicitly mentioned as the principal diagnosis at discharge. The summary clearly states that the primary diagnosis was \\'Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with acute kidney injury\\' in section 4 of Format 1. While the patient did present with nausea/vomiting, and these symptoms resolved during the admission, the documentation attributes the patient\\'s condition to ATN and volume depletion rather than viral gastroenteritis. The conclusion section reiterates that \\'the primary issue was ATN, likely precipitated by volume depletion from nausea/vomiting.\\' At no point in either format is viral gastroenteritis mentioned as a diagnosis, let alone as the principal diagnosis at discharge.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the principal diagnosis at discharge was \\'viral gastroenteritis.\\' The provided hospital course summary is presented in two formats: a standard section based summary and a problem based summary. In the standard section based summary, the \\'Primary Diagnosis\\' is listed as \\'Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with acute kidney injury,\\' and there is no mention of \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' or a similar condition. The \\'Reason for Admission\\' section mentions \\'nausea/vomiting and hypotension complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI),\\' which could be symptoms related to viral gastroenteritis, but the summary does not explicitly state this diagnosis. The problem based summary also focuses on \\'Acute Kidney Injury/ATN\\' and \\'Volume Depletion/Hypotension\\' without mentioning \\'viral gastroenteritis.\\' Therefore, based on the information provided in both summaries, the fact \\'principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis\\' is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed \\'Primary Diagnosis\\' section: States \\'Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with acute kidney injury\\' as the principal diagnosis. 2. Checked \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\': Includes volume depletion/hypotension and metabolic acidosis, but no mention of viral gastroenteritis. 3. Examined \\'Conclusion\\' section: Attributes AKI to volume depletion from nausea/vomiting, but does not specify viral gastroenteritis as the underlying cause of GI symptoms. 4. Scanned entire document for synonyms/abbreviations: No terms like \\'viral gastroenteritis,\\' \\'norovirus,\\' \\'enteritis,\\' or \\'gastroenteritis\\' appear in any diagnosis section. 5. Determined that while nausea/vomiting are documented symptoms, the etiology (viral gastroenteritis) is not explicitly stated as a diagnosis.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 15, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily stopped when the patient initially came to the hospital.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing both the standard section based summary and problem based summary: 1. Checked the \\'Medications\\' section which lists medications that were held (Entresto, home insulin, allopurinol) but does not mention tacrolimus, mycophenolate, or prednisone 2. Reviewed the \\'Problem #1: Acute Kidney Injury/ATN\\' section for any mention of immunosuppressant management none found 3. Scanned the entire document for any mention of immunosuppressant medications, transplant medication adjustments, or similar terms none found 4. While the patient is noted to be a kidney transplant recipient, there is no explicit mention of stopping immunosuppressant medications during this admission\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary is analyzed in two formats: Standard Section Based Summary and Problem Based Summary. To determine if the fact that \\'Immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily stopped when the patient initially came to the hospital\\' is mentioned, we need to look for any reference to these medications being held or adjusted during admission. In the \\'Standard Section Based Summary\\' under section \\'8. Medications: Held during admission:\\', it lists \\'Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan)\\', \\'Home insulin regimen\\', and \\'Allopurinol\\' as medications held but does not mention tacrolimus, mycophenolate, or prednisone. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' does not directly list medications held or adjusted. Since the specific immunosuppressants are not mentioned as being held or adjusted, and there\\'s no explicit mention of them being stopped temporarily upon admission, we conclude the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) Review the \\'Medications\\' section in Format 1, which lists \\'Held during admission\\' medications as Entresto, home insulin, and allopurinol. 2) Check Problem Based Summary (Format 2) and discharge conclusion for any reference to immunosuppressant management. 3) Note that tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone are standard post transplant immunosuppressants, but none are listed in the \\'Held during admission\\' section or mentioned elsewhere in the summary. 4) Observe that the conclusion states \\'temporary adjustment of medications\\' but does not specify immunosuppressants. Since the summary explicitly lists held medications and these three agents are absent, the fact is not explicitly stated despite their clinical relevance.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact \\'Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary, we need to analyze the provided summaries in both standard section based and problem based formats. In the standard section based summary, the patient was admitted for fever following chemotherapy, and investigations included blood cultures (no growth), chest X ray (bibasilar atelectasis), and other tests. The patient was diagnosed with SIRS/Non neutropenic fever and treated with antibiotics. The problem based summary highlights SIRS/Non neutropenic Fever as a problem with improved status but mentions intermittent low grade fevers and pending CT chest results. While the summaries indicate fever and suspected infection (as evidenced by antibiotic treatment), and negative infectious workups (e.g., blood cultures showed no growth), the specific mention of \\'suspected pulmonary infection\\' is not directly stated. However, the presence of bibasilar atelectasis on Chest X ray and pending CT chest results could imply a pulmonary concern. The key elements to the fact are: 1) persistent fever, 2) suspected pulmonary infection, and 3) negative infectious workups. \\'Persistent fever\\' is somewhat implied by \\'intermittent low grade fevers.\\' \\'Negative infectious workups\\' is supported by \\'blood cultures: no growth.\\' \\'Suspected pulmonary infection\\' is not directly stated but could be inferred from the context of antibiotic treatment and pending CT chest results.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary mentions \\'fever (T max 38.2°C)\\' on admission and \\'intermittent low grade fevers\\' in Problem #1, but does not explicitly use the term \\'persistent fever.\\' 2. While a chest X ray showed bibasilar atelectasis, there is no explicit mention of suspected pulmonary infection (e.g., pneumonia, bronchitis) in diagnoses or problem lists. 3. Negative infectious workups are clearly documented (negative blood cultures, low procalcitonin, clean urinalysis). However, the combination of \\'persistent fever\\' and \\'suspected pulmonary infection\\' is not explicitly stated together. The primary diagnosis of SIRS/non neutropenic fever and lack of pulmonary specific infection terminology lead to the conclusion that the full fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 18, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing both formats of the hospital course summary, while hypokalemia is mentioned (K 3.3 3.4) and potassium supplementation was given as part of treatment, there is no explicit mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) or its resolution. The summary mentions hypokalemia as a secondary diagnosis and documents potassium supplementation as part of therapeutic procedures, but does not indicate the presence of AKI or discuss kidney function. Additionally, while the hypokalemia is noted, there is no explicit statement about its resolution by the time of discharge. Therefore, the specific fact being searched for \\'Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\' is not fully present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact \\'Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\' is explicitly mentioned, we need to analyze the provided hospital course summaries in both standard section based and problem based formats. First, we look for mentions of \\'acute kidney injury\\' and \\'hypokalemia\\'. In the standard section based summary, under \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\', hypokalemia is listed (K 3.3 3.4), indicating its presence. However, there\\'s no direct mention of \\'acute kidney injury\\'. The problem based summary doesn\\'t directly mention either condition. We then check for resolution: the standard summary mentions \\'Improved with resolution of fever\\' under \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge\\', but doesn\\'t specify resolution of hypokalemia or mention kidney injury. The problem based summary outlines improvements and outstanding issues but doesn\\'t directly address the resolution of hypokalemia or kidney function. Since \\'acute kidney injury\\' is not mentioned at all and there\\'s no clear statement about the resolution of hypokalemia during admission, the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\' section: Hypokalemia (K 3.3 3.4) is listed, but no mention of acute kidney injury (AKI). 2. Checked \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\': No creatinine values, BUN, or urinalysis findings suggesting AKI (clean urinalysis noted). 3. Scanned \\'Therapeutic Procedures\\': Potassium supplementation documented, but no interventions for AKI (e.g., dialysis, fluid restriction). 4. Examined discharge condition: States resolution of fever and stable vitals, but no reference to AKI resolution or electrolyte normalization. 5. Analyzed Problem Based Summary: No AKI listed among active problems or resolved issues. Conclusion: While hypokalemia is documented, there is no explicit mention of AKI (required component of the fact) in any section. Resolution of either condition is not clearly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 19, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis).\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze this step by step: 1. The summary mentions bilateral hydronephrosis in the medical history section and confirms \\'bilateral mild hydroureteronephrosis\\' in the CT findings. 2. The summary does document urinary tract infections with: ESBL E. coli (mentioned as recent infection from 1/2023) Klebsiella (mentioned as recent infection from 2/2023) E. Faecalis (current infection) 3. However, while both the hydronephrosis and the UTIs are separately mentioned, the summary does not explicitly state that the hydronephrosis is complicated by these infections. The temporal and causal relationship between the hydronephrosis and UTIs is not clearly established in the text. 4. The infections are presented more in the context of being catheter associated (CAUTI) rather than as a complication of hydronephrosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly lists \\'Bilateral hydronephrosis\\' under Relevant Medical History and \\'mild hydroureteronephrosis\\' in CT findings. 2. Recurrent UTIs with ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella are documented in the medical history, and the current UTI is caused by E. Faecalis. 3. However, the summary does not explicitly state that hydronephrosis is complicated by\\' these infections. While both conditions are present, there is no direct statement linking hydronephrosis as being complicated by UTIs with these specific organisms. The causal relationship or complication status is implied but not explicitly articulated in a way that meets the \\'explicitly mentioned\\' threshold.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 19, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Chronic opioid use and opioid-related constipation. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed \\'Relevant Medical History\\' section: No mention of chronic opioid use. 2. Checked \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\': Lists \\'Chronic constipation\\' but no explicit link to opioids. 3. Examined \\'Medications\\': Hydromorphone (opioid) is listed as PRN for pain, but \\'chronic\\' use isn\\'t explicitly stated. 4. Analyzed \\'Problem #3: Chronic Pain Management\\': References controlled pain with oral medications but doesn\\'t specify chronic opioid therapy. 5. Noted bowel regimen (Miralax/senna) addresses constipation but no documentation attributing it to opioids. While components exist (opioid medication + chronic constipation), the summary never explicitly connects them or states \\'chronic opioid use\\' using those terms or clear synonyms.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 20, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** HHT with new PE/DVT s/p IVC filter placement as well as changed to fondaparinux\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) HHT is explicitly mentioned in the medical history. 2) \\'New PE/DVT\\' is addressed through documentation of DVT extension (primary diagnosis) and recent PE history (March/April 2023). 3) IVC filter placement on 5/10/2023 is clearly documented. 4) The anticoagulation change described in the summary is a transition FROM fondaparinux TO apixaban (Therapeutic Procedures section), which directly contradicts the \\'changed to fondaparinux\\' component of the target fact. While fondaparinux is mentioned in the context of being discontinued, there is no evidence of a new transition TO fondaparinux during this hospitalization. The combination of all required elements (HHT + new PE/DVT + IVC filter + fondaparinux initiation) is not fully satisfied due to the direction of anticoagulation change.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. The summary is presented in two formats: Standard Section Based Summary and Problem Based Summary. In the Standard Section Based Summary, under section 8 \\'Medications: Started/Modified\\', it is mentioned that \\'Prednisone increased to 100mg daily\\'. The Problem Based Summary, under \\'Problem #2: Thrombocytopenia\\', states that the patient had \\'Improving (latest count 82K)\\' thrombocytopenia with a \\'Prednisone 100mg daily\\' discharge plan. However, the phrase \\'s/p prednisone taper initiation\\' is not directly mentioned in either summary format. The closest relevant information is that prednisone was increased to 100mg daily, and the patient was discharged on this dose, indicating a high dose steroid therapy. There is no explicit mention of a \\'taper initiation\\'. The fact that the platelet count was improving (from 64K to 82K) suggests a positive response to the increased prednisone dose, but the specific phrase \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\' is not present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly mentions \\'progressive thrombocytopenia\\' under Reason for Admission, which is a clear synonym for \\'worsening thrombocytopenia.\\' 2. The Medications section states \\'Prednisone increased to 100mg daily,\\' indicating steroid therapy initiation. However, the summary does not mention a prednisone taper (i.e., planned dose decrease) at any point. While high dose steroids were started, the specific concept of a \\'taper initiation\\' (beginning to reduce the dose) is absent. The discharge plan for thrombocytopenia only specifies continued 100mg daily dosing without taper details. Thus, only the first part of the fact is explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 20, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed both the standard section based summary and the problem based summary. While there is mention of \\'Regular CBC monitoring\\' under Problem #2 (Thrombocytopenia) in the discharge plan, and \\'regular monitoring\\' is mentioned in several contexts, the specific frequency of \\'twice weekly CBCs\\' is not explicitly stated anywhere in the text. The summary indicates that monitoring will occur but does not specify the exact frequency of CBC checks. Therefore, while monitoring is planned, the specific fact about twice weekly frequency is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task requires determining if the fact \\'Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. The summary is presented in two formats: Standard Section Based Summary and Problem Based Summary. Upon reviewing both formats, the Standard Section Based Summary does not directly mention the frequency of CBC monitoring after discharge. However, the Problem Based Summary under \\'Problem #2: Thrombocytopenia\\' states \\'Regular CBC monitoring\\' as part of the discharge plan and goals. While it does not specify \\'twice weekly,\\' it implies ongoing CBC monitoring. To determine if this meets the criteria, we examine if \\'Regular CBC monitoring\\' can be considered equivalent to or imply \\'twice weekly CBCs.\\' The term \\'regular\\' could encompass various frequencies, including twice weekly, but it is not explicit. Nonetheless, given the context, a busy physician might interpret \\'regular CBC monitoring\\' as potentially including twice weekly CBCs, depending on the clinical context. However, the exact frequency \\'twice weekly\\' is not mentioned in either summary format.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis focused on identifying any mention of \\'twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\' in the hospital course summary. The \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' under Problem #2 (Thrombocytopenia) states \\'Regular CBC monitoring\\' but does not specify the frequency as \\'twice weekly.\\' While CBC monitoring is clearly indicated, the exact frequency requirement (twice weekly) is not explicitly stated in any section, including medications, therapeutic procedures, or discharge plans. The term \\'regular\\' is too vague to equate to a specific twice weekly schedule without additional clarification. Thus, the specific fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that while falls are mentioned multiple times (admission was \\'following multiple falls at home\\' and falls are listed as Problem #4), there is no explicit mention that the falls were recurrent during the hospital stay or that they remained of unknown etiology despite extensive workup. The summary actually suggests the falls were primarily addressed through management of the T6 fracture and rehabilitation planning, rather than being an ongoing mystery during the admission. While \\'Fall risk continues\\' is noted as an outstanding issue, this refers to future risk rather than active falls during the hospitalization. The summary does not indicate that the patient experienced continued falls during the admission or that there was an extensive but unsuccessful workup to determine their cause.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task requires determining whether the fact \\'recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. The summary is presented in two formats: Standard Section Based and Problem Based. Upon reviewing both formats, the Reason for Admission section mentions \\'multiple falls at home\\' as part of the admission reason, and there\\'s a specific section under Problem Based Summary for \\'Problem #4: Mobility/Falls\\' which notes \\'Fall risk continues\\' under Outstanding Issues. However, neither section explicitly states that the falls were \\'of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient.\\' The closest relevant information is found in the Reason for Admission and Problem #4, indicating the patient had falls and continued to have fall risk, but there\\'s no clear statement about the etiology being unknown after an inpatient workup. Thus, the specific fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly mentions \\'multiple falls at home\\' as part of the reason for admission and lists \\'Mobility/Falls\\' as Problem #4. 2. While a \\'fall evaluation\\' is referenced in the conclusion, there is no documentation of an extensive workup specifically for falls (e.g., neurology consult, EEG, carotid studies, or detailed balance assessments). 3. The text does not state that the etiology remains unknown instead, it lists resolved/controlled cardiac issues (NSVT managed with metoprolol) and structural findings (T6 fracture) that could explain some falls. 4. The \\'Outstanding Issues\\' for falls only note continued fall risk, not unexplained etiology. While the evaluation occurred, the summary lacks explicit documentation of both \\'extensive workup\\' and \\'unknown etiology\\' components required by the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The hospital course summary mentions a T6 compression fracture multiple times, but does not explicitly state that it likely occurred before the most recent fall. While the fracture is described as \\'new\\' in the CT findings and is mentioned in the reason for admission following \\'multiple falls,\\' there is no temporal assessment or suggestion that the fracture predated the most recent fall. The summary simply presents the fracture as a finding discovered during this admission without specifying when it occurred in relation to the patient\\'s falls. Since the specific timing relationship between the fracture and the most recent fall is not explicitly mentioned, this fact cannot be confirmed from the provided summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. The summary is presented in two formats: Standard Section Based Summary and Problem Based Summary. Upon reviewing both summaries, the primary diagnosis section in the Standard Section Based Summary mentions \\'Closed wedge compression fracture of T6 vertebra,\\' which directly relates to the T6 wedge compression fracture. However, neither summary explicitly states that the T6 wedge compression fracture \\'likely happened before the most recent fall.\\' The closest relevant information is found in the \\'Reason for Admission\\' section, which mentions the patient was admitted following multiple falls at home with subsequent identification of T6 compression fracture. This implies the fracture was identified after the falls but does not clearly state the timing or sequence relative to the \\'most recent fall.\\' Thus, while the summaries discuss the T6 compression fracture, they do not explicitly mention it happened before the most recent fall.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary clearly documents a T6 compression fracture in multiple sections (Reason for Admission, Primary Diagnosis, Problem #1). 2. The summary states the fracture was identified \\'following multiple falls,\\' but does not contain any explicit information about the fracture\\'s timing relative to the falls. 3. There is no mention of imaging findings suggesting chronicity (e.g., \\'old fracture\\' or \\'healing changes\\') or clinical documentation indicating the fracture predated the recent falls. 4. While the fracture is clearly present and associated with the falls contextually, the specific temporal relationship required by the fact (\\'likely happened before most recent fall\\') is not explicitly stated in any part of the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing both the standard section based summary and problem based summary formats, I find no explicit mention of continuing or re evaluating Augmentin therapy for 14 days. While the summary does discuss antibiotic therapy (specifically mentioning Zosyn), and includes information about treating the patient\\'s infection, there is no specific reference to Augmentin or a 14 day course. The only antibiotic explicitly mentioned is Zosyn in the medications section. The summary discusses continuing antibiotics in general terms (e.g., \\'Continue antibiotics\\' in the discharge plan), but does not specifically address Augmentin or a planned 14 day duration that needs re evaluation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'should continue and re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. The provided summary is in two formats: Standard Section Based Summary and Problem Based Summary. Upon reviewing both summaries, there is no mention of \\'Augmentin therapy\\' or its continuation. The Standard Section Based Summary mentions that the patient was \\'Started on Zosyn for infection,\\' and the Problem Based Summary states \\'Improving on antibiotics.\\' However, neither summary explicitly mentions \\'Augmentin\\' or discusses its continuation beyond the current treatment. Since \\'Augmentin\\' is not mentioned at all, the fact regarding its continuation is not present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The fact in question is whether there\\'s explicit mention of needing to \\'re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion.\\' 2. Reviewing the \\'Medications\\' section in the standard summary: Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam) is listed as the antibiotic started for infection, not Augmentin (amoxicillin clavulanate). 3. In the problem based summary under \\'Problem #1: Cholangitis/Biliary Drain Infection,\\' the discharge plan states \\'Continue antibiotics\\' but does not specify Augmentin or mention re evaluation of antibiotic duration. 4. The conclusion section mentions \\'improvement with antibiotics\\' generally but does not reference Augmentin or a planned reassessment of therapy duration. 5. No abbreviations, paraphrasing, or clinical synonyms for Augmentin (e.g., amoxicillin clavulanate) appear in either format of the summary. 6. While antibiotic continuation is mentioned, the specific drug (Augmentin) and the action to re evaluate its continuation before 14 days are absent. The summary instead documents Zosyn as the antimicrobial used.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 22, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** patient should follow up with Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/ Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Poultsides, George, MD in in 2 weeks\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing both the standard section based summary and problem based summary formats, there is no explicit mention of follow up appointments with either an Advanced Practice Provider in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. While the summary discusses the patient\\'s ongoing care needs and mentions that the patient is still admitted at the time of the last note, it does not specify any outpatient follow up appointments. The discharge planning sections focus on clinical goals (drain output, antibiotics continuation) but do not detail specific follow up scheduling. Even in the \\'Discharge Plan\\' subsections under each problem area, there are no mentions of scheduled follow up appointments with any providers.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The provided hospital course summary is analyzed in two formats: Standard Section Based Summary and Problem Based Summary. To determine if the specific fact about follow up appointments is mentioned, I examined both summaries. The Standard Section Based Summary includes sections like \\'Reason for Admission\\', \\'Relevant Medical History\\', \\'Primary Diagnosis\\', etc., but none of these sections explicitly mention follow up appointments. The Problem Based Summary outlines the patient\\'s issues and plans but also does not directly state the follow up appointments with an Advanced Practice Provider in 1 week and Dr. Poultsides, MD in 2 weeks. Since neither summary explicitly mentions the required follow up information, the fact is considered not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed in both standard and problem based formats. Key sections reviewed included \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' under each problem and the Conclusion. While discharge plans mention continuing medications, nutritional support, and coordination with Radiation Oncology for SBRT, there is no explicit reference to follow up appointments with an Advanced Practice Provider (NP/PA) in 1 week or Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. The text does notational mentions of pending SBRT and discharge goals but lacks any scheduling details or provider specific follow up instructions. No abbreviations or synonyms for these appointments are present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 23, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the provided hospital course summary in both formats, I do not find any explicit mention of cardiology coordinating follow up with the Heart Failure team, discussion of transcatheter MVR, or reference to a new clinical trial drug in 4/2023. While the summary does mention cardiology follow up (\\'Discharge Plan: Continue oral furosemide, follow up with cardiology\\' and \\'Outpatient cardiology follow up for valve evaluation\\'), and discusses mitral valve issues (\\'Mitral Stenosis\\' with \\'increased gradient noted on TTE\\'), it does not specifically mention the coordination with Heart Failure team, transcatheter MVR discussions, or any clinical trial. The closest related information is about the need for \\'potential valve intervention to be evaluated as outpatient\\', but this is not specific enough to match the fact we\\'re looking for.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. The summary is presented in two formats: a standard section based summary and a problem based summary. Upon reviewing both summaries, there is no explicit mention of \\'transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\' or any similar phrase that directly correlates with the given fact. The summaries mention follow up with cardiology for valve evaluation and management of heart failure, but they do not specify discussions about a new clinical trial drug or transcatheter MVR in the context provided. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) The required fact specifies cardiology coordinating follow up with Heart Failure team regarding transcatheter MVR and a clinical trial drug. 2) The hospital summary\\'s \\'Discharge Plan\\' sections mention cardiology follow up for valve evaluation and potential intervention, but do not reference: a) Collaboration with a Heart Failure team, b) Transcatheter MVR (only \\'valve intervention\\' generally), or c) Any clinical trial drug related to April 2023. 3) While cardiology follow up is clearly stated, none of the specific elements about team coordination, transcatheter approach, or trial drugs appear in any form (including abbreviations or synonyms). 4) The absence of these specific components meets the threshold for 0 under the guidelines, as no equivalent phrasing exists in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 24, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that part of the fact is explicitly mentioned but not the complete fact. The summary does indicate the patient was \\'transitioned to full liquid diet\\' (mentioned in both Format 1 under \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Progress\\' and in Format 2 under Problem #1). However, there is no explicit mention of discharge on oral pain medications. While acetaminophen is mentioned under \\'Medications,\\' it\\'s not specifically stated as part of the discharge plan. Since both components (full liquid diet AND oral pain medications at discharge) need to be present to consider this fact as fully mentioned, and only one component is clearly stated, this fact cannot be considered as completely mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Checked \\'Medications\\' section: Lists acetaminophen for pain control but does not specify route (oral vs IV). 2. Reviewed \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Progress\\': States \\'Transitioned to full liquid diet\\' but no mention of discharge medications. 3. Examined \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' in Problem Based Summary: Mentions diet advancement but no pain medication plan. 4. Conclusion: While full liquid diet is explicitly mentioned, oral pain medications are not clearly stated in discharge context. Acetaminophen use during hospitalization doesn\\'t confirm discharge prescription.\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 25, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** Step 1: Check for upper GI series findings. The summary explicitly states \\'Upper GI Series: No evidence of gastric outlet obstruction\\' but does not mention the duodenum. While this partially matches the fact, the absence of duodenal obstruction documentation creates a minor gap. Step 2: Evaluate medication sequence. The summary documents \\'Pantoprazole 40mg BID\\' initiation but lacks any mention of IV famotidine as a prior step, which is a key component of the fact. Step 3: Assess GI consultation details. While outpatient ERCP evaluation and PPI therapy are mentioned, there is no explicit documentation of case discussions with general/advanced GI teams or their decision to defer EGD/ERCP during hospitalization. Step 4: Apply guidelines. Though multiple elements (PPI course, partial upper GI findings, outpatient ERCP plan) are present, critical components (famotidine initiation, explicit GI team deferral of procedures) are missing. A busy physician would note these omissions as essential to the full fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**34. Patient 25, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact about AKI on admission being treated with fluids and resolving is partially explicitly mentioned in the summary. We can find this information in multiple places: 1. In section 5 (Secondary Diagnoses), \\'Acute kidney injury (resolved)\\' is listed 2. In section 8 (Medications), it mentions that Lasix and spironolactone were \\'temporarily held for AKI\\' 3. In the Conclusion section, it mentions \\'resolution of... AKI\\' as one of the notable achievements While the summary explicitly states that the AKI resolved and implies treatment by mentioning holding diuretics, it does not explicitly state that fluids were used as the treatment method. Therefore, while we know the AKI occurred and resolved, we cannot confirm from the text that fluids were specifically used as the treatment.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact \\'AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved\\' is explicitly mentioned, we need to analyze the provided hospital course summaries in both formats. In the Standard Section Based Summary, under \\'Secondary Diagnoses,\\' it is mentioned that the patient had \\'Acute kidney injury (resolved).\\' In the \\'Medications\\' section, it is noted that \\'Lasix and spironolactone (temporarily for AKI)\\' were held, indicating that the AKI was a reason for temporarily stopping these medications, suggesting treatment adjustment due to AKI. However, the specific treatment with fluids is not directly mentioned. In the Problem Based Summary, there is no direct mention of AKI or its treatment under the listed problems. The fact that AKI resolved is mentioned in the \\'Conclusion\\' section of the Problem Based Summary. While the summaries indicate that the AKI resolved, they do not explicitly state that it was treated with fluids. Nonetheless, the implication that AKI was present and resolved is clear, and holding diuretics can be considered a form of management related to AKI, though not explicitly \\'fluids,\\' it implies a management strategy related to fluid balance.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly lists \\'Acute kidney injury (resolved)\\' under Secondary Diagnoses and notes that Lasix/spironolactone were held \\'for AKI.\\' However, there is no explicit mention of fluid administration as the treatment modality for the AKI. While resolution of AKI is documented, the specific intervention of fluid therapy is not stated in either the standard or problem based summaries. The guidelines specify that minor wording gaps (e.g., omitting \\'with fluids\\') do not warrant a 0, but the absence of any reference to fluid administration—despite resolution being noted—means the full fact (AKI treated with fluids) is not explicitly present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**35. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the summary for explicit mention of a connection between emesis and chronic mesenteric ischemia via SMA stenosis. While the CT findings of \\'Moderate narrowing of proximal SMA\\' are mentioned in section 6, and nausea/vomiting are noted in section 1, the summary does not explicitly connect these findings or suggest chronic mesenteric ischemia as a potential cause. The gastric symptoms are instead attributed to acute gastritis/dyspepsia (sections 4 and 5) and gastroparesis (section 2). Though SMA stenosis is present, the CT report specifically states \\'no acute mesenteric ischemia\\' and makes no mention of chronic mesenteric ischemia. Without an explicit connection between the emesis and mesenteric ischemia, this specific fact cannot be considered present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. The summary is presented in two formats: Standard Section Based Summary and Problem Based Summary. In the Standard Section Based Summary, under section 6 \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\', it is mentioned that \\'CT Abdomen/Pelvis: Moderate narrowing of proximal SMA, no acute mesenteric ischemia\\'. Although this indicates SMA stenosis, it does not directly link the patient\\'s emesis to chronic mesenteric ischemia. The Problem Based Summary also does not explicitly mention this connection. The fact requires two components to be explicitly mentioned: the SMA stenosis and the relation of emesis to chronic mesenteric ischemia. While the CT finding of SMA stenosis is mentioned, the summary does not explicitly state that the patient\\'s emesis is related to chronic mesenteric ischemia. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary includes CT Abdomen/Pelvis results showing \\'moderate narrowing of proximal SMA\\' (SMA stenosis). 2. The summary explicitly states \\'no acute mesenteric ischemia\\' but does not mention chronic mesenteric ischemia. 3. While SMA stenosis is documented, there is no explicit connection made between this finding and the patient\\'s emesis in either the diagnostic conclusions, problem list, or discharge plans. 4. The vomiting is attributed to acute gastritis/dyspepsia and gastroparesis in the problem based summary, with resolution noted. 5. Though SMA stenosis could theoretically relate to chronic mesenteric ischemia, the summary does not state this association for the emesis, adhering strictly to acute etiologies.\\n\\n\\n\\n**36. Patient 27, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I searched the hospital course summary for any mention of a TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) performed specifically on 3/6/23. While the summary does mention a TTE showing \\'no evidence of vegetations\\' in the \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\' section, it does not specify the date of 3/6/23. Additionally, while it mentions the absence of vegetations, it does not explicitly state there was \\'no evidence of mass.\\' Since the fact we\\'re looking for requires both the specific date (3/6/23) and the explicit mention of both \\'no mass\\' and \\'no vegetations,\\' this exact fact is not fully present in the summary. While there is overlap in content (the TTE and lack of vegetations), the complete specific fact as stated is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. The summary is presented in two formats: Standard Section Based Summary and Problem Based Summary. In the Standard Section Based Summary, under section 6 \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results,\\' it is stated that \\'TTE: No evidence of vegetations.\\' However, the date of the TTE is not specified. The fact in question specifies a date (3/6/23) for the TTE. Since the date is not mentioned in the summary, we need to check if the absence of a date means the fact is not considered explicitly mentioned. The summary does mention a TTE without evidence of vegetations, which is a key part of the fact, but lacks the specific date. The \\'fact_mentioned\\' determination hinges on whether the lack of the specific date disqualifies it from being considered \\'explicitly mentioned.\\' Given that a busy physician would likely consider \\'TTE: No evidence of vegetations\\' as conveying the essential information, despite the date not being specified, this suggests the fact is partially supported. However, the exact date is not present, which is a crucial part of the fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'TTE: No evidence of vegetations\\' under Key Diagnostic Investigations. However, the summary does not specify the date of the TTE (3/6/23) or mention the term \\'mass.\\' While the absence of vegetations is clearly stated, the lack of both the date and the explicit mention of \\'mass\\' (or equivalent terms) means the fact as written is not fully addressed. A busy physician would note the vegetations finding but would likely require the date and the mass related conclusion to confirm the full fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**37. Patient 27, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Imaging Evidence: The CT Maxillofacial report notes \\'mildly enlarged tonsils,\\' which qualifies as imaging supporting tonsillitis. 2. Localizing Symptoms: While specific symptoms (e.g., sore throat) aren\\'t detailed, the diagnosis of \\'tonsillitis\\' in Secondary Diagnoses implies clinical symptoms localized to the tonsils. 3. Antibiotic Treatment: Though vancomycin/piperacillin tazobactam are listed under medications, Problem #3 (Tonsillitis) explicitly states treatment with fluconazole/nystatin (antifungals), not antibiotics. Antibiotics here target CoNS bacteremia, not tonsillitis. Conclusion: While imaging and tonsillitis diagnosis are present, the summary specifies antifungal—not antibiotic—treatment for tonsillitis. The fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**38. Patient 28, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After analyzing the hospital course summary, I find that the specific fact about PTBD exchange on 4/21/23 is not explicitly mentioned. While the summary does discuss biliary obstruction and mentions several PTBD related procedures (including exchanges), the specific date 4/21/23 is not listed. The only PTBD procedures mentioned are: 1. Initial left PTBD placement on 3/17/2023 2. PTBD exchange to 14Fr on 3/25/2023 3. PTBD exchange to 16Fr with repositioning on 4/8/2023 While the patient clearly has recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD interventions, the specific exchange on 4/21/23 is not documented in this summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. The summary is analyzed in various sections. The \\'Reason for Admission\\' section lists biliary obstruction with persistent hyperbilirubinemia, which aligns with the fact. However, the specific date of PTBD exchange is found in the \\'Relevant Surgical History\\' and \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' sections. The \\'Relevant Surgical History\\' mentions a PTBD exchange to 14Fr on 3/25/2023, and \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' mentions a PTBD exchange to 16Fr with repositioning on 4/8/2023. Neither section mentions a PTBD exchange on 4/21/23. The closest information is the PTBD exchange on 4/8/2023, which is 13 days before the specified date. The fact is not explicitly mentioned because the date of PTBD exchange does not match.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** Step 1: Identify key elements of the fact: (1) admission for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction, (2) hyperbilirubinemia, (3) PTBD exchange on 4/21/23. Step 2: The \\'Reason for Admission\\' explicitly states \\'biliary obstruction with persistent hyperbilirubinemia\\' and the primary diagnosis confirms malignancy. Step 3: The \\'Therapeutic Procedures\\' section lists a PTBD exchange on 4/8/23, not 4/21/23. Step 4: While all clinical elements (recurrent malignant obstruction, hyperbilirubinemia, PTBD exchange) are present, the specific date 4/21/23 for the exchange is absent. Since the date discrepancy creates a material difference in procedural timing (not just wording variation), the exact fact as stated is not fully captured.\\n\\n\\n\\n**39. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I find that while some elements of the fact are present (transition to hospice care is mentioned), the specific claim that \\'bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange\\' is actually contradicted by the text. The summary explicitly states that there was improvement in total bilirubin from 16.8 to 10.8, and describes this as \\'improved but persistent hyperbilirubinemia.\\' While the patient did ultimately transition to hospice care, this appears to be part of a broader goals of care discussion rather than specifically due to failed bilirubin improvement. The text indicates the transition to hospice was made \\'after discussions with palliative care and family\\' but doesn\\'t link this decision to a lack of bilirubin response. Therefore, since the provided fact specifically claims bilirubin did not improve (when it actually did) and links the hospice decision directly to this non improvement (which isn\\'t stated), this specific fact as written is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s condition and treatment. To determine if the fact \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice\\' is mentioned, we need to check two main components: (1) the effect of PTBD exchange on bilirubin levels and (2) the decision to transition to home hospice. The summary indicates that total bilirubin decreased from 16.8 to 10.8, suggesting some improvement after PTBD exchange. It also mentions that the patient was transitioned to hospice care. However, it does not explicitly state that bilirubin \\'did not improve\\' despite PTBD exchange; instead, it shows an improvement. Thus, the first part of the fact is not accurately represented. The second part, regarding transitioning to home hospice, is mentioned. Since the fact is not accurately represented in its entirety, particularly the first part regarding bilirubin improvement, it is considered not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly states \\'serial liver function tests showing improvement in total bilirubin from 16.8 to 10.8\\' following PTBD exchange (listed under Key Diagnostic Investigations and in Problem #1), directly contradicting the first part of the fact about bilirubin not improving. 2. The transition to home hospice is clearly documented in multiple sections (Conclusion, Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge, Problem #4). However, since the first component of the fact (bilirubin not improving) is explicitly contradicted by the documented improvement, the combined fact as stated is not present in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**40. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text for each component of the fact: 1. Sepsis requiring antibiotics and fluid resuscitation: The text mentions \\'healthcare associated infection requiring antibiotics\\' and that the patient \\'Required ongoing IV fluid support\\' However, sepsis is not explicitly mentioned While these elements suggest possible sepsis, it\\'s not explicitly stated 2. Delirium requiring pharmacotherapy: Delirium is mentioned multiple times in the summary However, there\\'s no explicit mention of pharmacotherapy for delirium Text only mentions \\'periods of agitation requiring sitter\\' 3. Urinary retention requiring catheter: No mention of urinary retention or catheter use anywhere in the text While some elements are present (infection, antibiotics, fluids, delirium), the specific combination of sepsis with aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium with pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention with catheter is not fully or explicitly stated in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. Let\\'s analyze the given summary step by step. The summary is divided into two formats: Standard Section Based Summary and Problem Based Summary. In the Standard Section Based Summary, under \\'Secondary Diagnoses,\\' it is mentioned that the patient had \\'Delirium\\' and \\'Healthcare associated infection requiring antibiotics.\\' Under \\'Medications,\\' it is stated that the patient was \\'Started on empiric Piperacillin Tazobactam,\\' which indicates the use of antibiotics. The Problem Based Summary further elaborates on the patient\\'s issues, including \\'Delirium/Mental Status\\' and the need for ongoing \\'IV fluid support\\' under \\'Volume Status/Renal Function.\\' However, there is no explicit mention of \\'sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation\\' or \\'urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\' The \\'Healthcare associated infection requiring antibiotics\\' and the use of \\'IV fluid support\\' could be related to sepsis and fluid resuscitation, but it is not explicitly stated. Delirium is mentioned, but there is no specific mention of \\'pharmacotherapy.\\' Therefore, the exact fact as stated is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis requiring antibiotics: The summary mentions \\'Healthcare associated infection requiring antibiotics\\' under Secondary Diagnoses, which aligns with sepsis treatment. 2. Aggressive fluid resuscitation: \\'Required ongoing IV fluid support\\' in Problem #3 and discontinuation of ACE inhibitors for hypotension indicate fluid management. 3. Delirium requiring pharmacotherapy: While delirium is listed in Secondary Diagnoses and Problem #2, there\\'s no explicit mention of pharmacotherapy for delirium (only \\'requires sitter\\'). 4. Urinary retention requiring catheter: No mention of urinary retention or catheter placement in any section. Two of three required components (urinary retention management and delirium pharmacotherapy) are missing from the fact\\'s criteria.\\n\\n\\n\\n**41. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary carefully, I found that while the patient\\'s nasopharyngeal carcinoma and delirium are both mentioned separately, there is no explicit statement about deferring cancer management to outpatient oncology due to the son\\'s wishes and delirium. The summary does mention that \\'Treatment decisions pending patient\\'s improved mental status\\' and \\'Final treatment plan to be determined outpatient,\\' but it doesn\\'t specifically state that this was due to the son\\'s wishes combined with the patient\\'s delirium. While these elements are related, the specific causative relationship described in the fact is not explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. The summary is presented in two formats: Standard Section Based Summary and Problem Based Summary. In the Standard Section Based Summary, under section 9 \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge,\\' it is mentioned that the patient \\'requires strict NPO status\\' and has \\'Mental status improved but remains intermittently confused,\\' indicating delirium. The Problem Based Summary under \\'Problem #2: Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma\\' states that \\'Treatment decisions pending patient\\'s improved mental status\\' and \\'Family discussion regarding goals of care needed,\\' which implies that management decisions are pending due to the patient\\'s condition and potentially family input. However, neither summary explicitly states that the management was deferred per the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes. Thus, while there are hints at the reasons (delirium and need for family discussion), the specific fact about the son\\'s wishes is not directly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states under Problem #2 (Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma) that \\'Treatment decisions [are] pending patient\\'s improved mental status\\' and \\'Final treatment plan to be determined outpatient.\\' It also notes the patient\\'s \\'intermittently confused\\' mental status at discharge. While these elements address deferral to outpatient oncology and delirium, the summary does not explicitly mention the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes as a reason for deferral. The phrase \\'family discussion regarding goals of care needed\\' implies family involvement but does not specifically attribute the deferral decision to the son. Since the son\\'s role in the decision making process is not directly stated, the full fact as phrased is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**42. Patient 29, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. The summary is given in two formats: Standard Section Based Summary and Problem Based Summary. In the Standard Section Based Summary, under \\'Secondary Diagnoses,\\' \\'Aspiration pneumonitis\\' is listed. Under \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results,\\' \\'Serial CXRs showing bilateral lower lobe opacities consistent with aspiration\\' is mentioned, indicating aspiration occurred. In \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge,\\' it is stated that the patient \\'Requires strict NPO status.\\' The Problem Based Summary under \\'Problem #3: Aspiration Risk/Dysphagia\\' also confirms \\'Unsafe for any oral intake\\' and \\'Strict NPO status\\' as part of the discharge plan. However, there is no explicit mention of a \\'temporary O2 requirement\\' in either summary format. Therefore, while the summaries mention aspiration pneumonitis and strict NPO status, they do not explicitly state that the patient developed a temporary O2 requirement.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary lists \\'Aspiration pneumonitis\\' under Secondary Diagnoses and mentions \\'serial CXRs showing bilateral lower lobe opacities consistent with aspiration\\' in diagnostics. 2. \\'Strict NPO status\\' is explicitly stated in both the discharge condition and Problem #3\\'s discharge plan. 3. While SLP involvement is implied through the swallow evaluation noting \\'unsafe for oral intake,\\' the text does not explicitly state that SLP ordered the NPO. 4. The \\'temporary O2 requirement\\' component of the fact is not mentioned anywhere in the summary. While aspiration pneumonitis and NPO status are present, the oxygen requirement and SLP\\'s role in NPO ordering are not explicitly documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n### B.

All Inconsistent Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 1, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypoxia 2/2 recurrent R pleura effusion\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states hypoxia is due to recurrent right pleural effusion. 2. Hospital summary documents \\'oxygen saturation in mid 80s on room air\\' at discharge despite \\'improved\\' effusion and chest tube removal. 3. Persistent hypoxia after effusion resolution creates contradiction regarding stated etiology.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 4, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention\\' requiring Foley placement 2. Hospital Summary documents CKD Stage IV as \\'stable at baseline\\' in Problem #4 3. No mention of AKI in diagnoses or clinical status sections 4. Creatinine 3.64 (consistent with CKD IV baseline) without documentation of acute rise 5. Foley placement attributed solely to urinary retention management, not AKI treatment 6. Summary explicitly states CKD remained \\'stable\\' throughout admission\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states adrenal crisis was \\'likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone\\'. 2. Hospital Summary lists hydrocortisone (not prednisone) as the steroid used during treatment and discharge. 3. No documentation of prednisone use or intolerance in medications section or problem lists. 4. Summary instead confirms successful transition to oral hydrocortisone without complications. 5. Absence of prednisone use in the clinical record directly contradicts the stated cause of crisis.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states the patient is on \\'Levemir 16 units BID\\' for diabetes management 2. The fact states insulin was changed to \\'lantus 15 units twice a day\\' 3. These are different insulins (Levemir vs Lantus) and different doses (16 units vs 15 units) 4. While both are long acting insulins given twice daily, they represent different treatment plans\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions that the patient was transitioned to \\'Levemir 16 units BID\\' under the \\'Medications: Started/Modified\\' section, and also under \\'Problem #3: Type 1 Diabetes Management\\'. The Important Fact states that \\'insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day\\'. The discrepancy lies in the type of insulin (Lantus vs Levemir) and the dosage (15 units vs 16 units). Lantus and Levemir are both long acting insulins but are not the same. Thus, the summary contradicts the fact because it states the patient was discharged on Levemir, not Lantus, and a different dosage.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states insulin was changed to Lantus 15 units BID. 2. Hospital Summary Medications section lists \\'Levemir 16 units BID\\' under Started/Modified. 3. Lantus (insulin glargine) and Levemir (insulin detemir) are different basal insulins. 4. Both the insulin type (Lantus vs Levemir) and dose (15 vs 16 units) differ between the fact and summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 7, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left renal cell carcinoma status-post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post-op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\' prior to nephrectomy/IVC thrombectomy. 2. Hospital Course Summary (Therapeutic Procedures and Medications sections) documents surgery and post op care but contains no mention of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 3. Absence of chemotherapy documentation in the perioperative timeline creates contradiction, as neoadjuvant therapy would precede surgery in standard treatment sequencing.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 7, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Continued on apixaban post-op\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'Continued on apixaban post op\\' implying uninterrupted use. 2. Hospital summary\\'s Medications section specifies \\'Plan to restart home apixaban\\' and mentions SQ heparin was used perioperatively. 3. Conclusion states \\'planned reinitiation\\' of anticoagulation, indicating apixaban was paused during hospitalization. 4. These statements conflict with the assertion of continued apixaban use post operatively.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 8, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Down\\'s syndrome, neurogenic bladder, admitted for pneumonia, treated with CAP regimen and vancomycin due to positive sputum culture for MRSA\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'positive sputum culture for MRSA\\' as reason for vancomycin. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s sputum culture shows \\'light growth of Staphylococcus aureus\\' without specifying MRSA. 3. Summary indicates vancomycin was added \\'due to MRSA+\\' from nares screen, not sputum. 4. MRSA identification in sputum vs nares represents different infection sites. 5. Conflict exists between reported MRSA location driving treatment (sputum vs nares).\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary makes no mention of an aspiration event prior to discharge 2. The summary does not discuss any blood culture results showing GPC (Gram positive cocci) 3. The summary actually states \\'Blood cultures: No growth\\' which directly contradicts the fact about 1/4 bottles being positive for GPC 4. The timing and completeness of culture results are not addressed in the summary, but the blood culture result statement is definitively different from the fact\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by discharge\\'. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s sputum culture shows \\'Light growth of Staphylococcus aureus\\', which is a speciated GPC. 3. This indicates speciation WAS completed (identified as Staph aureus), directly contradicting the fact\\'s claim of incomplete speciation. 4. Summary makes no mention of any pending cultures or unspecified GPC results.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary indicates patient was treated with Piperacillin Tazobactam (Zosyn), while the fact states Cipro treatment 2. The summary shows active inpatient treatment of sepsis with Zosyn, while fact suggests completing an outpatient Cipro course 3. While both mention finasteride initiation and sepsis from urinary source, the antibiotic treatments are different 4. These differences in antibiotic therapy represent a clear contradiction, as they cannot both be true for the same treatment course\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was diagnosed with complicated UTI with pyelonephritis and sepsis due to Klebsiella pneumoniae and was treated with Piperacillin Tazobactam. The summary also mentions that Finasteride was initiated for prostatomegaly. The Important Fact states that the patient had sepsis from a urinary source with potential pyelonephritis and was finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge, and was started on finasteride to prevent future UTIs. The summary does not mention cipro or a 7 day antibiotic course; instead, it mentions treatment with Piperacillin Tazobactam. This indicates a contradiction between the antibiotic used and potentially the duration/course of treatment.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states patient was \\'finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge\\' and \\'started on finasteride\\'. 2. Hospital Summary lists \\'Piperacillin tazobactam\\' as the antibiotic used (under Medications) and \\'antibiotic course per sensitivities\\' (under Discharge Plan) but never mentions ciprofloxacin. 3. Both cipro and piperacillin tazobactam cannot simultaneously be the discharge antibiotic for this infection. 4. Finasteride initiation is confirmed in both documents with no conflict.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 12, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient sent to the hospital from home for symptoms of tachycardia, hypotension, found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula\\n\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states patient was found to have a NEW gallbladder enteric fistula during this admission. 2. Hospital summary lists \\'Recent gallbladder enteric fistula\\' under Relevant Medical History (pre admission context). 3. CT imaging during admission showed \\'fluid collection around gallbladder without visualized fistula\\'. 4. The fistula is documented as a pre existing condition (secondary diagnosis), not a new finding during this hospitalization.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions several post operative complications that make the course not \\'unremarkable\\': Labile hypertension with peaks at 202/114 mmHg Post operative skin reaction/blistering on coccyx Hyperglycemia requiring insulin adjustment (glucose 139 245 mg/dL) Complex pain management needed (ketamine/lidocaine infusions, PCA) 2. These complications required active management and monitoring 3. While the patient recovered successfully, the course had notable events requiring intervention, contradicting an \\'unremarkable\\' post operative course\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'unremarkable post operative course\\' but Hospital Course Summary documents multiple complications: labile hypertension (BP up to 202/114 mmHg), hyperglycemia (up to 245 mg/dL), post op pain requiring IV to oral transition, and coccyx blistering. 2. These complications required active management (antihypertensives, insulin adjustments, multimodal pain control), contradicting the \\'unremarkable\\' characterization. 3. While resolved by discharge, their presence constitutes a non unremarkable postoperative course.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 13, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt has significant mental health history including anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder and did have a panic attack while admitted \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states history of anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, and in hospital panic attack. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s \\'Relevant Medical History\\' lists bipolar, PTSD, depression but omits anxiety and borderline personality disorder. 3. No documentation of panic attack occurrence in any section (Key Investigations, Medications, or Discharge Condition). 4. Psychiatric medications (BuSpar, Seroquel, trazodone) are consistent with anxiety treatment but don\\'t confirm diagnosis. 5. Direct contradiction exists between stated \\'borderline personality disorder\\' in Fact and its absence in Summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows DM2 was affected during hospitalization: Reports \\'moderate hyperglycemia requiring insulin adjustment\\' Documents elevated glucose range of 139 245 mg/dL Notes diabetes \\'required adjustment of insulin coverage\\' 2. These findings indicate worsening of diabetes control perioperatively, contradicting the fact stating DM2 was not worsened 3. The need for insulin adjustment and documented hyperglycemia clearly demonstrate perioperative deterioration of glycemic control\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions \\'Type 2 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia (glucose range 139 245 mg/dL)\\' under Secondary Diagnoses and \\'Blood glucose monitoring: Range 139 245 mg/dL\\' under Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results. It also states \\'moderate hyperglycemia requiring insulin adjustment\\' under Problem #4: Diabetes Management. These indicate that the patient\\'s DM2 was not entirely stable perioperatively, contradicting the Important Fact that her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were not worsened perioperatively.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary clearly states the primary diagnosis as \\'Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with acute kidney injury\\' in section 4. 2. The clinical course, workup, and management described throughout focus on ATN, volume depletion, and kidney injury. 3. There is no mention of viral gastroenteritis as a diagnosis anywhere in the summary. 4. While nausea/vomiting is mentioned as a presenting symptom, the workup and final diagnosis point to ATN rather than viral gastroenteritis. 5. The entire treatment course (IV fluids, holding medications, monitoring renal function) aligns with managing ATN, not viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Principal diagnosis at discharge was viral gastroenteritis, but the Hospital Course Summary indicates the primary diagnosis was Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) with acute kidney injury. The summary does not mention viral gastroenteritis as a diagnosis. The presence of nausea and vomiting could be related to viral gastroenteritis, but the summary attributes it to volume depletion causing ATN. The contradiction lies in the principal diagnosis not matching between the fact and the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states principal diagnosis: viral gastroenteritis. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s Primary Diagnosis lists \\'Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with acute kidney injury\\'. 3. No mention of gastroenteritis in diagnoses. 4. ATN etiology in summary is attributed to volume depletion from nausea/vomiting, but no infectious cause specified. 5. Conflicting principal diagnoses (ATN vs. viral gastroenteritis) cannot coexist as primary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows negative infectious workups: Blood cultures: No growth Clean urinalysis Low procalcitonin (0.09) Chest X ray only showed atelectasis, not infection 2. While fever was present initially, it resolved by discharge (\\'resolution of fever\\' in discharge condition) 3. There\\'s no mention of pulmonary infection only bibasilar atelectasis on chest X ray 4. The fever improved with treatment, rather than being \\'persistent\\' 5. Therefore, this contradicts the fact which claims \\'persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\'\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was admitted for fever following methotrexate chemotherapy and had a suspected infection, but the workup remained largely negative. Key points include: 1. The patient was started on empiric antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin, with vancomycin later discontinued) due to fever. 2. Blood cultures showed no growth throughout admission. 3. Procalcitonin was 0.09, suggesting a low likelihood of bacterial infection. 4. The patient improved clinically with resolution of fever and stable vital signs at discharge. The Important Fact states \\'Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups.\\' The summary does not directly mention a suspected pulmonary infection; it mentions bibasilar atelectasis on Chest X ray but does not confirm a pulmonary infection. The fever did resolve, contradicting \\'persistent fever.\\' Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the fact because it indicates resolution of fever.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 18, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\'. 2. Hospital Summary lists hypokalemia (K 3.3 3.4) as a secondary diagnosis and documents potassium supplementation. 3. No mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) in any diagnosis section. 4. Discharge condition notes resolution of fever but does not state hypokalemia resolution. 5. AKI resolution cannot be confirmed as it was never documented. 6. Both AKI presence and hypokalemia resolution are unsubstantiated in the summary, creating contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 20, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** HHT with new PE/DVT s/p IVC filter placement as well as changed to fondaparinux\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient has HHT with new PE/DVT and is status post (s/p) IVC filter placement, and was changed to fondaparinux. The Hospital Course Summary confirms HHT diagnosis, recent history of RLE DVT and PE, and IVC filter placement on 5/10/2023. However, it indicates that the patient was transitioned from fondaparinux to apixaban, contradicting the fact that the patient was changed to fondaparinux. Thus, the summary conflicts with the Important Fact regarding the anticoagulation therapy change.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states patient was \\'changed to fondaparinux\\' for HHT with PE/DVT. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s Therapeutic Procedures section documents \\'Transition from fondaparinux to apixaban\\'. 3. Medications list shows apixaban was started, not fondaparinux. 4. These statements directly conflict regarding anticoagulant use.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The fact states \\'worsening thrombocytopenia\\' but the summary shows improving platelet counts: Explicit trend shown: 72 → 64 → 67 → 82 Summary states \\'platelet count improved from 64K to 82K\\' 2. The fact mentions \\'prednisone taper initiation\\' but the summary shows: Prednisone was actually increased to 100mg daily No mention of taper initiation Both elements directly contradict the important fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'worsening thrombocytopenia\\' with \\'s/p prednisone taper initiation\\' 2. Hospital summary shows platelet count improved (72 → 64 → 67 → 82) during hospitalization 3. Summary specifies prednisone was increased to 100mg daily (not tapered) 4. Thrombocytopenia is documented as \\'improving\\' in Problem #2 with latest count 82K 5. These findings directly contradict the reported worsening thrombocytopenia post taper initiation\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary indicates a clear cause for the falls they led to a T6 compression fracture 2. The summary details multiple evaluations that revealed specific findings (CT head, cardiac monitoring showing NSVT, etc.) 3. The workup identified several potential contributing factors to falls including: Heart failure with reduced EF Cardiac arrhythmia Dementia Mobility issues 4. This contradicts the fact stating falls were of \\'unknown etiology despite extensive workup\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states this is a \\'new T6 compression fracture\\' in the diagnostic investigations section 2. This directly contradicts the Important Fact which states the T6 wedge compression fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall\\' 3. The summary\\'s characterization of the fracture as \\'new\\' and the Important Fact\\'s assertion that it predated the recent fall cannot both be true\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that the patient was admitted following multiple falls at home with subsequent identification of T6 compression fracture. It also lists \\'Closed wedge compression fracture of T6 vertebra\\' as the Primary Diagnosis and mentions \\'New T6 compression fracture\\' as a finding on CT chest/abdomen/pelvis. These statements imply that the T6 compression fracture occurred around the time of the recent falls. The Important Fact suggests that the T6 wedge compression fracture likely happened before the most recent fall. The summary and the fact cannot both be true because they imply different timings for when the fracture occurred relative to the falls.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the T6 fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall\\'. 2. The Hospital Summary states the fracture was identified \\'following multiple falls at home\\', implying the falls led to fracture discovery. 3. These statements conflict because the fracture cannot be both pre existing (Important Fact) and caused by the falls described in the admission reason (Summary).\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 23, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** large pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'large pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis\\' 2. Summary reports thoracentesis removed 1.75L from initial 2400cc effusion 3. Post procedure, Problem #2 notes \\'persistent loculated right pleural effusion\\' 4. Residual effusion (~650cc) would be moderate, not large 5. Fact claims large effusion remains post procedure, summary indicates reduction to smaller volume\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 23, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states Cardiology will coordinate with Heart Failure team for transcatheter MVR and clinical trial drug discussion 2. Hospital Summary\\'s Problem #3 discharge plan only mentions \\'outpatient cardiology follow up for valve evaluation\\' without specifying Heart Failure team involvement 3. No mention of transcatheter MVR or clinical trial drug in either summary format 4. Summary\\'s valve intervention plan remains non specific (\\'potential intervention to be evaluated\\') while Fact specifies concrete plans\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions CT findings of \\'Moderate narrowing of proximal SMA\\' which aligns with the fact\\'s mention of SMA stenosis. 2. However, the summary explicitly states \\'no acute mesenteric ischemia\\' and attributes the patient\\'s symptoms to acute gastritis/dyspepsia and gastroparesis. 3. The summary\\'s diagnostic workup and treatment plan focus on gastritis and gastroparesis rather than chronic mesenteric ischemia. 4. While both documents note SMA stenosis, they differ in the clinical interpretation the fact suggests it as a cause of emesis, while the summary rules out ischemia as a cause.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia due to SMA stenosis. 2. Hospital Summary notes CT showed \\'moderate narrowing of proximal SMA\\' but specifically states \\'no acute mesenteric ischemia\\'. 3. Summary attributes vomiting to acute gastritis/dyspepsia (resolved) and gastroparesis (managed with diet), with no mention of chronic mesenteric ischemia as a contributor. 4. These are mutually exclusive explanations for the emesis.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states PICC removal/replacement was performed. 2. Hospital summary under \\'Therapeutic Procedures\\' only documents PICC removal (3/5/23). 3. No mention of PICC replacement in any section. 4. Both removal and replacement would need to be documented to match the fact. 5. Omission of replacement creates direct conflict with stated treatment in the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 27, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions \\'Tonsillitis\\' under Secondary Diagnoses and discusses its management under Problem #3: Oral Thrush/Tonsillitis, indicating that tonsillitis was identified and treated. The Important Fact states \\'Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\' However, the summary indicates treatment with antifungal therapy (fluconazole and nystatin) rather than antibiotics, suggesting a contradiction.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states tonsillitis was treated with antibiotics. 2. Hospital Summary lists tonsillitis under Secondary Diagnoses and Problem #3. 3. Medications show antifungals (fluconazole, nystatin) for thrush/tonsillitis, but no antibiotics specifically for tonsillitis. 4. Vancomycin/piperacillin tazobactam target bacteremia, not explicitly tonsillitis. 5. Summary\\'s antifungal treatment for tonsillitis directly contradicts antibiotic treatment stated in Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 28, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows PTBD exchange to 16Fr on 4/8/2023, not 4/21/23 2. The summary lists multiple PTBD interventions but none on 4/21/23 3. The chronological events in the summary stop at 4/8/2023 4. Since the dates are different and there\\'s no mention of a 4/21/23 PTBD exchange, this represents a clear contradiction\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states PTBD exchange occurred on 4/21/23. 2. Hospital Summary lists PTBD exchange to 16Fr on 4/8/23 under Therapeutic Procedures. 3. No mention of PTBD exchange on 4/21/23 in the summary. 4. These dates (4/8 vs 4/21) represent conflicting procedure dates that cannot both be true.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states bilirubin improved from 16.8 to 10.8 (\\'Serial liver function tests showing improvement in total bilirubin from 16.8 to 10.8\\') 2. This directly contradicts the Important Fact which states \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange\\' 3. Both statements about hospice transition are consistent, but the bilirubin trajectories cannot both be true 4. The contradiction is further reinforced in the Problem Based Summary which notes \\'Improved but persistent hyperbilirubinemia\\'\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient\\'s total bilirubin improved from 16.8 to 10.8 following PTBD exchange and other interventions. This contradicts the Important Fact that states \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange\\'. The summary clearly shows an improvement in bilirubin levels, thus conflicting with the fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange. 2. Hospital summary documents \\'improvement in total bilirubin from 16.8 to 10.8\\' after PTBD exchange (Key Diagnostic Investigations) and \\'successful PTBD revision with some improvement in hyperbilirubinemia\\' (Conclusion). 3. These statements directly conflict regarding bilirubin response to PTBD intervention.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the hospital course was complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter. The Hospital Course Summary under \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\' lists \\'Healthcare associated infection requiring antibiotics\\', which aligns with the sepsis requiring antibiotics mentioned in the Important Fact. It also mentions \\'Delirium\\' under \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\' and \\'Persistent confusion, requires sitter\\' under \\'Problem #2: Delirium/Mental Status\\', supporting the occurrence of delirium. The summary does not explicitly mention \\'sepsis\\', but \\'Healthcare associated infection requiring antibiotics\\' can be considered consistent with sepsis. The summary does not directly mention \\'aggressive fluid resuscitation\\', but \\'Required ongoing IV fluid support\\' under \\'Problem #3: Volume Status/Renal Function\\' implies fluid resuscitation efforts. The summary does not mention \\'urinary retention requiring urinary catheter\\' at all. Since \\'urinary retention requiring urinary catheter\\' is not mentioned in the summary and is a part of the Important Fact, the absence directly contradicts the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact mentions urinary retention requiring catheter not mentioned in summary 2. Summary lists \\'Healthcare associated infection requiring antibiotics\\' and IV fluids, consistent with sepsis management 3. Delirium is noted in summary but pharmacotherapy not explicitly stated (only \\'requiring sitter\\') 4. Urinary retention absence creates direct contradiction as both cannot be true\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Presence of important facts\\n\\n**Score: 53/100** (95% CI: 43-63) (higher values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the important facts missing:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries frequently omit critical clinical facts due to recurring patterns: (1) **ambiguous or generalized documentation** failing to specify details (e.g., Patient 0’s JP drain laterality, Patient 4’s AKI omission despite CKD), (2) **incomplete procedural reporting** excluding key interventions (e.g., Patient 1’s chest tube removal, Patient 2’s adhesion takedown), (3) **missing quantitative data** like lab values (e.g., Patient 0’s hemoglobin 8.8, Patient 17’s ketosis), (4) **unstated medication specifics** (e.g., Patient 6’s insulin type/dose discrepancy, Patient 20’s anticoagulant sequence), (5) **assumed clinical milestones** without explicit documentation (e.g., Patient 2’s bowel function recovery), and (6) **omitted causal relationships** (e.g., Patient 19’s hydronephrosis-UTI link, Patient 28’s bilirubin-hospice decision disconnect). Additionally, **diagnostic ambiguities** (Patient 15’s viral gastroenteritis) and **unreported events** (Patient 8’s aspiration, Patient 13’s panic attack) highlight systemic gaps in capturing nuanced clinical reasoning or patient-specific contexts. These patterns collectively reflect prioritization of brevity over granularity, leading to fragmented narratives.\\n\\n### B. Hospital course summaries contradicting important facts\\n\\n**Score: 15/100** (95% CI: 7-23) (lower values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the inconsistencies:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries frequently exhibit inconsistencies with clinical facts due to recurring patterns, including contradictory documentation of interventions (Patient 0: JP drain removal vs. retention), medication regimen discrepancies (Patient 6: Levemir vs. Lantus dose/type; Patient 20: fondaparinux vs. apixaban), and misclassification of condition timelines (Patient 12: \"new\" vs. chronic fistula; Patient 21: \"new\" T6 fracture vs. pre-existing). Other failures involve incomplete documentation of clinical status, such as underreporting complications (Patient 13: unremarkable course vs. pain/hypertension issues; Patient 28: unresolved hypokalemia vs. \"resolved\" AKI) or omitting treatments (Patient 9: missing cipro/finasteride; Patient 28: absent sepsis/urinary retention details). Terminology errors (Patient 27: CoNS bacteremia mislabeled as MRSA; \"coagulase-negative strep\" vs. *Staphylococci*) and conflicting interpretations of clinical response (Patient 28: bilirubin levels \"improved\" vs. \"no improvement\") further contribute to inconsistencies. These patterns highlight systemic issues in accuracy, terminology precision, and reconciliation of interdepartmental data.\\n\\n## Detailed results\\n\\n### A.

All Missing Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 0, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left-sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I find no explicit mention of a left sided abdominal JP drain being present at discharge. While the summary does mention \\'surgical drains\\' in the Brief Description section (\\'removal of surgical drains\\') and includes \\'drain management\\' in the Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section, it does not specifically state that a left sided JP drain remained in place at discharge. In fact, the Brief Description suggests that surgical drains were removed (\\'with removal of surgical drains\\') before preparation for discharge. While drain management is listed as a follow up item, this could refer to monitoring the healing of drain sites rather than managing an existing drain. Without explicit confirmation that a left sided JP drain was present at discharge, I must conclude this fact is not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if the fact \\'Left sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary mentions \\'removal of surgical drains\\' on POD 8, indicating that drains were removed before discharge. However, it also lists \\'Follow up wound care and drain management\\' under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\', which could imply that some form of drain management was still required post discharge. Despite this ambiguity, there is no explicit mention of a \\'Left sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\'. The presence of \\'drain management\\' in the follow up could suggest a drain was left in, but it doesn\\'t specify the type, location, or laterality of the drain. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states under \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' that there was \\'removal of surgical drains and preparation for discharge.\\' This indicates drains were removed prior to discharge. While \\'Follow up wound care and drain management\\' is listed under Outstanding Issues, there is no explicit mention of a left sided abdominal JP drain being left in place at discharge. The text specifically notes drain removal as part of the discharge preparation process.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 0, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Discharged with DVT prophylaxis, with anemia at hemoglobin 8.8\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze this step by step: 1. For DVT prophylaxis: The summary mentions \\'Lovenox anticoagulation teaching and prescription\\' as the first item in Outstanding Issues/Follow Up, confirming DVT prophylaxis at discharge. 2. For anemia: The summary mentions \\'anemia requiring transfusion\\' in the Brief Description and lists \\'Microcytic anemia\\' in Relevant Medical History. However, while anemia is clearly present, the specific hemoglobin value of 8.8 is not mentioned anywhere in the text. 3. Since both components (DVT prophylaxis AND anemia with Hgb 8.8) must be present for the fact to be considered fully mentioned, and the specific hemoglobin value is missing, we must mark this as not fully mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient had anemia requiring transfusion post operatively. The hemoglobin level is not explicitly stated in the summary provided. However, under \\'Relevant Medical History,\\' it is noted that the patient has a history of microcytic anemia. The summary also lists \\'Lovenox anticoagulation teaching and prescription\\' under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up,\\' indicating that the patient was to be discharged with DVT prophylaxis. Although the hemoglobin level of 8.8 is not directly mentioned, the presence of anemia and the plan for DVT prophylaxis with Lovenox are noted.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. DVT prophylaxis: The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section explicitly states \\'Lovenox anticoagulation teaching and prescription.\\' Lovenox (enoxaparin) is a standard DVT prophylaxis, fulfilling this component. 2. Anemia at hemoglobin 8.8: While the summary mentions \\'requiring transfusion\\' for anemia and lists \\'microcytic anemia\\' in medical history, there is no reference to a hemoglobin level of 8.8 in any section. The specific hemoglobin value is critical to this fact and is absent. Since one component (hemoglobin 8.8) is missing, the full fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 1, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** R chest tube was placed with drainage; intrapleural alteplase given; chest tube removed\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient \\'Underwent right chest tube placement with subsequent tPA administration for loculations.\\' This is further detailed under \\'Problem #1: Recurrent Right Pleural Effusion\\' where it states \\'Therapeutic Procedures: Right chest tube placement, tPA administration (6mg)\\'. However, the summary does not explicitly mention the removal of the chest tube. The key fact to look for is \\'R chest tube was placed with drainage; intrapleural alteplase given; chest tube removed\\'. While \\'R chest tube placement\\' and \\'tPA administration\\' (alteplase is a synonym for tPA) are mentioned, the removal of the chest tube is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the fact is not entirely mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'right chest tube placement\\' and \\'tPA administration (6mg)\\' in both the Brief Description and Problem #1 sections. The removal of the chest tube, however, is not explicitly stated. While the summary notes the patient left AMA and had a \\'persistent small effusion,\\' there is no direct reference to the chest tube being removed. The absence of this specific detail means the full fact (placement, alteplase, removal) is not completely addressed, even though two of the three elements are present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 2, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed. Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The hospital course summary mentions a laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed due to a necrotic small bowel mass. However, while the surgical intervention is mentioned, the specific detail about taking down adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall is not explicitly stated. Additionally, while the summary mentions a necrotic mass was present and surgical intervention was performed, it doesn\\'t explicitly detail the process of removing the obstructing necrotic mass. The summary provides a more general description of the procedure as \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' without these specific surgical details. While the overall procedure type matches, the specific technical details about adhesion takedown and the process of mass removal are not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient underwent \\'successful laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis.\\' This information is found in the \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' and \\'Problem Based Summary\\' under \\'Problem #1: Small Bowel Mass/Metastatic Sarcoma.\\' The specific details about adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall being taken down and obstructing necrotic mass being removed are not explicitly mentioned. However, the summary does confirm that a laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed, which matches part of the fact to be verified.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) The summary explicitly states \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' under both the Brief Description and Problem #1, confirming the third part of the fact. 2) The \\'necrotic small bowel mass\\' is mentioned as the surgical target, but the term \\'obstructing\\' is not used. While resection implies removal, the specific descriptor \\'obstructing\\' (a key element of the fact) is absent. 3) The first part of the fact (\\'adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down\\') is entirely absent from the summary, with no mention of adhesions, omentum, or abdominal wall in the surgical details. Since two critical components (adhesions and \\'obstructing\\' descriptor) are missing, the fact as a whole is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 2, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient recovered from surgery well; had flatus and bowel movement \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of the patient having flatus or bowel movement post surgery. While the summary indicates that the patient had an \\'uncomplicated\\' post operative course with \\'gradual advancement of diet and activity\\' and was \\'stable post operatively with improved symptoms\\', it does not specifically mention return of bowel function through flatus or bowel movement. Even though these are typical milestones in post operative recovery that would likely have been achieved given the patient was deemed stable for discharge, we cannot assume their occurrence without explicit documentation in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient underwent a laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis and that her post operative course was uncomplicated with gradual advancement of diet and activity. While it does not explicitly state that the patient \\'had flatus and bowel movement,\\' the fact that her diet was gradually advanced post operatively implies recovery of bowel function, which typically includes passing flatus and having a bowel movement. However, the exact phrase or a direct equivalent is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states the patient had an \\'uncomplicated\\' post operative course with \\'gradual advancement of diet and activity.\\' While diet advancement typically implies return of bowel function (flatus/bowel movements), the terms \\'flatus\\' or \\'bowel movement\\' are not explicitly documented. The text does notational shorthand (e.g., \\'diet advancement\\') that clinicians would interpret as evidence of bowel recovery, but per the strict guidelines requiring explicit mention (even via synonyms/abbreviations), the specific fact is not directly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 4, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze this step by step: 1. The fact we\\'re looking for has several components: AKI on CKD Due to urinary retention Treated with foley catheter placement 2. From the summary: CKD is clearly mentioned (CKD Stage IV) Urinary retention and foley placement are explicitly mentioned However, while CKD is mentioned, there is no mention of AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) occurring during this admission 3. The summary shows: Baseline CKD with creatinine 3.64 No indication of acute worsening No mention of AKI or acute deterioration of kidney function 4. While the urinary retention and treatment with foley are present, the critical component of AKI is missing from the narrative. Therefore, while some elements are present, we cannot say this specific fact (AKI on CKD) is explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions the patient\\'s history of CKD Stage IV and the occurrence of urinary retention, which required Foley catheter placement. Although the summary does not directly state \\'AKI on CKD\\', it provides creatinine and BUN levels during admission, indicating the patient\\'s kidney function. The presence of CKD and urinary retention treated with Foley catheter placement is clearly documented. However, the summary does not explicitly mention \\'AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement\\'. It does mention the patient\\'s CKD status and the treatment for urinary retention. The term \\'AKI\\' is not used in the summary, but the creatinine level is provided, suggesting some assessment of kidney function. The fact that the patient has CKD and was treated for urinary retention with a Foley catheter is mentioned, but the specific phrase \\'AKI on CKD\\' is not present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions urinary retention requiring Foley catheter placement and the patient\\'s history of CKD IV. However, there is no mention of acute kidney injury (AKI) superimposed on CKD (AKI on CKD). The nephrology section specifically states the patient\\'s CKD is \\'at baseline\\' with creatinine 3.64 and BUN 37, but does not describe an acute deterioration. While urinary retention (a potential cause of post renal AKI) and its treatment with Foley are documented, the text never explicitly states that AKI occurred or was attributed to retention. The absence of terms like \\'AKI\\', \\'acute kidney injury\\', \\'worsening renal function\\', or equivalent phrasing in the summary indicates this fact is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 5, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Increased bloody output from JP drain observed on POD1, gradually improved\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states that the patient had \\'bloody JP drain output requiring close monitoring\\' in the Brief Description and Problem #3 sections. However, there is no explicit mention of the timing (POD1) or a description of gradual improvement. While the need for monitoring is documented, the specific temporal detail (POD1) and progression (gradual improvement) components of the fact are absent from the text. A physician would recognize the presence of bloody output but would not find confirmation of its timing or improvement trajectory as described in the target fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly states that the patient was admitted for an adrenal crisis due to primary adrenal insufficiency as part of Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2. The summary under \\'Problem #1: Adrenal Crisis\\' lists key diagnostic findings and therapeutic procedures, confirming the presence of adrenal crisis. However, the specific reason for the adrenal crisis is not directly stated as being due to intolerance of PO prednisone. Instead, the patient was managed with IV hydrocortisone and eventually transitioned to PO hydrocortisone, indicating that the crisis was likely managed without PO prednisone. The summary implies that the adrenal crisis was due to the patient\\'s condition rather than intolerance to a specific medication like PO prednisone. Nonetheless, the fact that the patient was in adrenal crisis with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune polyglandular syndrome is clearly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient has primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2 and was admitted for adrenal crisis. However, the summary does not mention \\'intolerance of PO prednisone\\' as a contributing factor. The treatment involved IV hydrocortisone followed by transition to oral hydrocortisone (not prednisone), and there is no documentation of prednisone use or intolerance. While the adrenal crisis etiology is linked to the underlying condition, the specific claim about prednisone intolerance is absent.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** While the summary mentions Type 1 diabetes and insulin changes, the specific change to Lantus 15 units twice a day is not mentioned. Instead, the discharge plan indicates \\'Levemir 16 units BID\\' (a different long acting insulin) and insulin lispro. The hospital course shows the patient was on an insulin drip that was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin, but the specific regimen mentioned in the fact (Lantus 15 units BID) is not present. Since the insulin regimen mentioned is different from what we\\'re looking for (Levemir instead of Lantus, and 16 units instead of 15 units), this specific fact must be marked as not present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions the patient\\'s Type 1 Diabetes under \\'Problem #3: Type 1 Diabetes\\'. It details the therapeutic procedures and discharge plan, stating that the patient was transitioned from an \\'insulin drip → subcutaneous insulin\\'. The discharge plan specifies \\'Levemir 16 units BID\\' (twice a day), which is a different insulin type (Levemir, also known as detemir) and dose (16 units) compared to \\'Lantus 15units twice a day\\'. Although the insulin type (Lantus, which is glargine) and dose (15 units) mentioned in the fact are not exactly the same as Levemir (detemir) 16 units, both are long acting insulins. However, the exact fact \\'insulin changed to Lantus 15units twice a day\\' is not explicitly mentioned. The discharge plan mentions a different long acting insulin (Levemir) at a slightly different dose (16 units).\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly addresses the patient\\'s Type 1 diabetes management in Problem #3. Under \\'Discharge Plan\\', it specifies \\'Levemir 16 units BID\\' and \\'insulin lispro 1:7 ratio TID\\'. While this confirms a basal bolus insulin regimen was implemented, Lantus (insulin glargine) is not mentioned. Levemir (insulin detemir) is a different long acting insulin. The summary does not use the term \\'Lantus\\', abbreviations for it, or equivalent phrasing. The dose of 16 units BID also differs from the 15 units specified in the target fact. Though both regimens involve basal insulin adjustments, the specific fact about Lantus 15 units BID is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 7, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left renal cell carcinoma status-post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post-op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy. \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient underwent a left radical nephrectomy and IVC tumor thrombectomy for renal cell carcinoma with tumor thrombus. The \\'One Liner\\' section directly states this information. Furthermore, \\'Problem #1: Left Renal Mass with IVC Tumor Thrombus\\' section provides detailed information about the diagnosis and treatment, confirming the presence of left renal cell carcinoma and the surgical procedures performed. Although the summary does not explicitly mention \\'neoadjuvant chemotherapy,\\' it does confirm the presence of left renal cell carcinoma, the surgical procedures (left nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy), and the context of a significant medical condition being treated. The key elements of the fact are largely covered, with the exception of explicitly stating \\'neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\\' However, the presence of this detail is not crucial given the other information provided directly relates to the condition and treatment.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** Step 1: Identify key components of the fact: (1) Left renal cell carcinoma, (2) status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy, (3) post op left nephrectomy, (4) IVC thrombectomy. Step 2: Verify left renal cell carcinoma is mentioned in the one liner and Problem #1. Step 3: Confirm nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy are documented in multiple sections (one liner, hospital course, Problem #1). Step 4: Search for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The summary mentions \\'resumption of immunotherapy\\' in follow up but never references neoadjuvant chemotherapy (pre operative chemotherapy). While all other components are explicitly stated, the neoadjuvant chemotherapy component of the fact is absent. No equivalent terms or abbreviations for preoperative chemotherapy are found in the document.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 7, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second-line\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of a hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo (ipilimumab/nivolumab) or a switch to cabozantinib as second line therapy. While the summary does reference immunotherapy in two places: 1) \\'Follow up with primary oncology team regarding resumption of immunotherapy\\' and 2) \\'Outstanding Issues: Timing of immunotherapy resumption\\', it does not specify which immunotherapy agents were used, nor does it mention any hypersensitivity reactions or treatment changes. The document focuses primarily on the patient\\'s surgical course for renal cell carcinoma and immediate post operative complications. Any previous adverse reactions to immunotherapy or changes in medication regimens are not documented in this summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention a hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo (ipilimumab/nivolumab) or a switch to cabozantinib as a second line treatment. The summary mentions \\'Timing of immunotherapy resumption\\' under \\'Outstanding Issues\\' for \\'Problem #1: Left Renal Mass with IVC Tumor Thrombus\\', indicating that the patient was on immunotherapy, but it does not specify the type of immunotherapy or any reactions to it. It also does not mention cabozantinib or any change in the treatment regimen.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section: Mentions follow up with oncology regarding \\'resumption of immunotherapy\\' but does not state why immunotherapy was paused. 2. Scanned all problem summaries (including Problem #1 renal mass details): No mention of hypersensitivity reaction to ipilimumab/nivolumab (ipi/nivo) or any immunotherapy related adverse event. 3. Checked discharge medications and therapeutic procedures: Cabozantinib is not listed in any section. 4. No documentation of drug reactions/allergies in \\'Relevant Medical History\\' or elsewhere. While immunotherapy resumption is planned, the reason for discontinuation (hypersensitivity) and switch to cabozantinib are never explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, the specific fact about a potential aspiration event prior to discharge with 1/4 bottles positive for GPC and incomplete speciation is not explicitly mentioned anywhere in the text. The summary does discuss respiratory issues and pneumonia, but: 1. There is no mention of any aspiration event near discharge 2. While blood cultures are mentioned (\\'Blood cultures: No growth\\'), there is no reference to 1/4 bottles being positive for GPC 3. There is no discussion of pending or incomplete speciation results The only positive culture mentioned is a sputum culture growing Staphylococcus aureus and a positive MRSA nasal swab. The patient\\'s discharge appears to have been routine after clinical improvement, with no mention of new respiratory events or pending culture results.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, there is no mention of a potential aspiration event, the number of bottles positive for GPC (Gram Positive Cocci), or the status of speciation. The summary discusses the patient\\'s admission for community acquired pneumonia, treatment, and improvement but does not include any information related to the specified fact. Therefore, the fact is not mentioned in the hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not mention a potential aspiration event prior to discharge. While dysphagia and G tube dependence (aspiration risk factors) are noted, no explicit aspiration event is documented. The sputum culture identified Staphylococcus aureus (a GPC organism, but this is already speciated in the report), and blood cultures showed no growth. There is no reference to \\'1/4 bottles\\' (commonly used in blood culture terminology) being positive for GPC with pending speciation. The absence of these specific details, despite documentation of other microbiology results, indicates the fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 8, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Neurogenic bladder, high risk of UTI\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly lists \\'neurogenic bladder/bowel\\' under both the Brief Description and Problem #2. 2. The management section for Problem #2 describes straight catheterization 4x/day and urine output monitoring, which are interventions for neurogenic bladder. 3. While neurogenic bladder inherently carries UTI risk, the summary does not explicitly state \\'high risk of UTI\\' or equivalent phrasing. 4. The guidelines specify that both elements of the fact must be present. Since only neurogenic bladder is explicitly mentioned without direct reference to UTI risk, the combined fact is not fully stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the key components of the fact against the hospital course: 1. Sepsis from urinary source/pyelonephritis: CONFIRMED The summary explicitly states \\'complicated UTI/pyelonephritis with associated sepsis\\' in the one liner and details this throughout. 2. 7 day course of cipro on discharge: NOT MENTIONED While antibiotics are mentioned (Vancomycin and Zosyn), there\\'s no specific mention of Cipro or a 7 day course. The discharge plan only mentions \\'Complete antibiotic course based on sensitivities\\' without specifying the drug or duration. 3. Started on finasteride: NOT MENTIONED While there is mention of prior UTIs and current UTI treatment, there is no mention of finasteride or any other preventive medications for future UTIs. While the core condition (sepsis from urinary source/pyelonephritis) is present, two key elements (Cipro course and finasteride) are not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about Mr. Kreiger\\'s admission for complicated UTI/pyelonephritis with associated sepsis and confusion. The summary under \\'Problem #1: Complicated UTI/Sepsis\\' outlines the diagnosis, treatment, and discharge plan. It mentions that the patient was treated with antibiotics and improved clinically. However, it does not explicitly state that the patient was finishing a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin on discharge; instead, it mentions completing an antibiotic course based on sensitivities. The antibiotics used during the hospital stay were Vancomycin and Zosyn, later continued on Zosyn alone. There is no mention of ciprofloxacin or finasteride being started to prevent future UTIs in the discharge plan or anywhere else in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly states \\'complicated UTI/pyelonephritis with associated sepsis\\' in the one liner and Problem #1, confirming sepsis from a urinary source with pyelonephritis. 2. The discharge plan mentions completing antibiotics but does not specify a 7 day course of cipro (treatment was initially vancomycin/zosyn, then zosyn alone). 3. There is no mention of finasteride initiation in any section (medications, discharge plan, or problem lists). While the sepsis source is confirmed, the antibiotic duration/drug and finasteride components of the fact are absent.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 9, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling, DVT US negative, unclear etiology \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of right upper extremity or left lower extremity swelling, nor any mention of DVT ultrasound studies. The summary covers the patient\\'s presentation with UTI/sepsis, diabetes management, and incidental finding of possible NPH, but does not discuss any extremity swelling or related diagnostic workup. The physical exam findings and diagnostic studies described focus on the urinary infection, mental status, and neurological findings. While the summary includes various diagnostic tests (CT A/P, urine cultures, labs), there is no mention of DVT ultrasound or any evaluation of extremity swelling.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary is analyzed to determine if it mentions \\'Right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling, DVT US negative, unclear etiology\\'. Upon reviewing the summary, there is no mention of swelling in the right upper extremity or left lower extremity. Additionally, there is no reference to a DVT ultrasound being performed or its results. The summary focuses on the patient\\'s admission for complicated UTI/pyelonephritis with sepsis and confusion, and other related issues. Therefore, the specific fact about swelling and DVT US is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed section by section. The \\'One Liner\\' and \\'Brief Description\\' focus on UTI/pyelonephritis, sepsis, and NPH. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' details UTI treatment, diabetes management, and NPH evaluation. \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' includes neurology referral, antibiotics, walker DME, and diabetes follow up. No sections mention extremity swelling, DVT ultrasound results, or etiologic uncertainty regarding swelling. The DME arrangement for a walker suggests mobility issues but does not address swelling. The medical/surgical histories also do not contain this information. The specific combination of right upper and left lower extremity swelling with negative DVT imaging and unclear etiology is absent from all documented findings and plans.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 10, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** The patient had alcohol ketosis on presentation \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary in detail, there is no explicit mention of alcohol ketosis on presentation. While the summary discusses alcohol related issues including alcohol withdrawal and alcohol use disorder, and mentions a \\'transient metabolic acidosis\\' during the hospital course, it does not specifically state that the patient had alcohol ketosis on presentation. The metabolic acidosis mentioned could be from various causes and is not explicitly linked to ketosis. Even though alcohol ketosis would be a plausible finding in a patient with heavy alcohol use presenting for withdrawal, we cannot assume its presence without explicit documentation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'alcohol ketosis\\' on presentation. The summary discusses the patient\\'s admission for alcohol withdrawal management, recent heavy alcohol use, and mentions a transient metabolic acidosis during the hospital course. While alcohol ketosis could be a cause of metabolic acidosis, the summary does not directly state that the patient had alcohol ketosis. The presence of metabolic acidosis is mentioned, but its cause is not specified as alcohol ketosis. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'transient metabolic acidosis\\' as a complication but does not explicitly state \\'alcohol ketosis\\' or a synonymous term. While alcohol related metabolic acidosis (e.g., alcoholic ketoacidosis) is a potential cause, the summary does not specify the etiology of the acidosis, nor does it reference ketones, ketonemia, or ketonuria. The absence of direct terminology or clear clinical synonyms (e.g., \\'ketoacidosis,\\' \\'elevated ketones\\') supports the conclusion that the fact is not explicitly documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 11, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for a fall with humerus fracture and pain\\n\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient was admitted after a mechanical fall resulting in a right humerus fracture. While pain management (oxycodone) is mentioned in the discharge plan for the fracture, the summary does not explicitly state that pain was a presenting symptom or reason for admission. The admission reason focuses on the fall and fracture, with pain addressed as part of management rather than an explicit admission factor. Therefore, the specific combination of \\'admitted for a fall with humerus fracture and pain\\' is not fully articulated in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 12, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient sent to the hospital from home for symptoms of tachycardia, hypotension, found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula\\n\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Patient sent to the hospital from home for symptoms of tachycardia, hypotension, found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. The summary indicates the patient was admitted for \\'hypotension, tachycardia, and failure to thrive\\' and had a history of gallbladder enteric fistula. The \\'One Liner\\' section states the patient has a history of gallbladder enteric fistula, suggesting it is not new. The \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' mentions the patient was admitted for evaluation of hypotension and tachycardia. The CT showed a fluid collection around the gallbladder without clear fistula visualization. The fact that the patient was sent from home is not directly stated but can be inferred from the context that the patient was discharged home and then presumably readmitted. However, the summary does not explicitly state the patient was sent from home for symptoms. It also does not clearly indicate the gallbladder enteric fistula was new. Thus, the fact is not entirely explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 12, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was started on empiric antibiotics but was found to have a normal WBC with normal lactate and abx were discontinued, he was not discharged on antibiotics\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I searched the hospital course summary for any mention of antibiotics and their discontinuation. While the summary mentions the patient\\'s hemodynamic instability and shows a normal WBC count (\\'Labs showed BUN 45, normal WBC\\'), there is no explicit mention of: 1) Starting empiric antibiotics, 2) Having a normal lactate, or 3) Discontinuing antibiotics. Additionally, there is no mention of the patient\\'s antibiotic status at discharge. Although we can see various aspects of the patient\\'s treatment including IV fluids, vasopressors, and TPN management, the specific antibiotic course described in the fact is not documented in this summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention that the patient was started on empiric antibiotics or that they were discontinued due to normal WBC and lactate levels. It also doesn\\'t state whether the patient was discharged on antibiotics. The summary does mention \\'Conservative management, NPO initially\\' under Problem #2: Gallbladder Enteric Fistula, but this does not directly imply antibiotic use. Therefore, the specific fact about being started on empiric antibiotics, having normal WBC and lactate leading to their discontinuation, and not being discharged on antibiotics is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary mentions \\'normal WBC\\' in Problem #1\\'s key diagnostic investigations. 2. There is no mention of empiric antibiotics being started at any point in the summary. 3. While lactate levels are not explicitly referenced, the absence of antibiotic initiation or discontinuation documentation is critical. 4. The discharge plan sections across all problems do not list antibiotics, but this alone doesn\\'t confirm they were discontinued. 5. The combination of empiric antibiotic initiation followed by discontinuation due to normal WBC/lactate is not described in any part of the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 12, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was discharged on TPN with instructions to follow up in 4 weeks  \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the summary for explicit mention of discharge on TPN with 4 week follow up instructions. While the summary clearly indicates the patient was discharged on TPN (mentioned in multiple places, including \\'Discharge Plan: Cyclic TPN via Soleo Health infusion\\' and \\'discharged home with continued TPN\\'), there is no specific mention of a 4 week follow up timeframe. The summary indicates follow up is needed for multiple issues (TPN management, imaging, nutrition) but does not specify the 4 week interval. Since both components of the fact (TPN at discharge AND 4 week follow up) must be present, and one is missing, this specific fact is not fully mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if the fact \\'He was discharged on TPN with instructions to follow up in 4 weeks\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary indicates that the patient was discharged home with continued TPN, and under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\', it lists \\'Outpatient nutrition follow up for TPN management\\'. However, the specific timeframe of \\'4 weeks\\' for follow up is not mentioned in the summary. The discharge plan under \\'Problem #3: Nutrition/TPN Management\\' mentions cyclic TPN and continuing nutrition follow up, but again does not specify a 4 week follow up. Thus, while discharge on TPN is mentioned, the specific instruction to follow up in 4 weeks is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly states under \\'Discharge Plan\\' for Problem #3 (Nutrition/TPN Management): \\'Cyclic TPN via Soleo Health infusion.\\' 2. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists \\'Outpatient nutrition follow up for TPN management.\\' 3. While TPN continuation at discharge is clearly documented, the specific instruction to \\'follow up in 4 weeks\\' is not mentioned anywhere in the text. The summary references outpatient follow up generally but does not specify a 4 week timeframe. 4. The absence of this temporal detail means the exact fact (TPN discharge + 4 week follow up instruction) is not fully present, even though TPN itself is mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly states the patient was admitted for bilateral mastectomy with lymph node dissection for breast cancer. 2. The postoperative course is described as \\'notable for\\' multiple complications (pain management challenges, skin reactions, hypertension), which directly contradicts \\'unremarkable\\' postoperative course. 3. Discharge home is implied through discharge planning details. Since the key element of an \\'unremarkable\\' postoperative course is explicitly negated by documented complications, the full fact (including unremarkable recovery) is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 13, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt has significant mental health history including anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder and did have a panic attack while admitted \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the presence of each component of the fact: 1. Mental health history: Bipolar disorder: Explicitly mentioned in both one liner and medical history PTSD: Explicitly mentioned in both one liner and medical history Anxiety: Not explicitly mentioned Borderline personality disorder: Not explicitly mentioned 2. Panic attack during admission: Not mentioned anywhere in the hospital course While the summary does document some of the patient\\'s mental health conditions (bipolar disorder and PTSD), it does not mention anxiety or borderline personality disorder. Additionally, there is no documentation of a panic attack occurring during the admission. The hospital course describes other complications (pain management issues, skin reaction, hypertension) but no psychiatric events. Therefore, the complete fact as stated is not fully present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Pt has significant mental health history including anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder and did have a panic attack while admitted\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. The summary lists the patient\\'s relevant medical history, which includes bipolar disorder and PTSD, aligning with part of the mental health history mentioned. However, it does not mention \\'anxiety\\' or \\'borderline personality disorder.\\' Moreover, there is no mention of the patient having a panic attack during admission. The presence of bipolar disorder and PTSD in the medical history partially matches the fact, but the absence of the other mental health conditions and the specific incident of a panic attack means the fact is not fully mentioned. Thus, the fact is not explicitly mentioned in its entirety.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions the patient\\'s history of bipolar disorder and PTSD under both the \\'One Liner\\' and \\'Relevant Medical History\\' sections. However, anxiety and borderline personality disorder are not listed in any part of the document. Additionally, while the summary notes \\'episodes of hypertension\\' and pain management challenges, there is no explicit mention of a panic attack occurring during admission. The absence of three key components of the fact (anxiety, borderline personality disorder, and panic attack) means the full fact as stated is not present in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary to determine if it explicitly states that chronic medical conditions, including DM2, were not worsened perioperatively. My analysis steps were: 1. Searched for direct statements about diabetes/DM2 status 2. Looked for indirect mentions of diabetes complications or worsening 3. Found only one relevant mention under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' noting \\'Diabetes management with elevated glucose readings\\' 4. Found no explicit statement indicating that chronic conditions remained stable or were not worsened 5. While glucose elevations were noted, there is no clear statement about whether this represents a worsening from baseline or typical perioperative variation 6. The summary does not make any direct claim about the stability or non worsening of chronic conditions perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. The summary mentions the patient\\'s history of type 2 diabetes (DM2) and other chronic conditions. It details the postoperative course, noting challenges such as pain management, coccyx blistering/skin reaction, and episodes of hypertension, but does not directly state that DM2 or other chronic conditions were worsened perioperatively. However, it does list \\'Diabetes management with elevated glucose readings\\' under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\', indicating that diabetes was not perfectly controlled postoperatively. The presence of \\'elevated glucose readings\\' suggests that diabetes management was a concern, implying some level of worsening or complication perioperatively. Nonetheless, the summary does not explicitly state that chronic conditions were not worsened. A careful reading shows that while there are indications of diabetes management being a concern postoperatively, there is no explicit statement regarding the perioperative status of chronic conditions like DM2 not being worsened.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly lists \\'Diabetes management with elevated glucose readings\\' under Outstanding Issues/Follow Up. While this indicates attention to glycemic control, there is no explicit statement that DM2 was not worsened perioperatively. The summary documents elevated glucose as an active issue but does not contextualize it as stable, unchanged, or uncomplicated relative to baseline. The absence of a clear affirmation of stability (e.g., \\'DM2 remained well controlled\\' or \\'no perioperative exacerbation of diabetes\\') means the specific fact in question is not explicitly stated, even though DM2 is mentioned as requiring management.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find an explicit mention of viral gastroenteritis as the principal discharge diagnosis. While the summary describes symptoms that could be consistent with gastroenteritis (nausea/vomiting), and discusses the patient\\'s course of illness and resolution, it does not specifically attribute these symptoms to a viral cause. The summary lists these symptoms under \\'Problem #2: Nausea/Vomiting with Hypotension\\' but does not provide an etiological diagnosis. The treatment course (IV fluids, antiemetics) could be consistent with viral gastroenteritis, but without an explicit statement of this as the principal or final diagnosis, we cannot assume this was the discharge diagnosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the principal diagnosis at discharge was \\'viral gastroenteritis\\'. The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' as a diagnosis. The summary describes the patient\\'s presentation with nausea/vomiting and AKI, and after investigation, initial concerns for infection were ruled out. The patient\\'s symptoms of nausea/vomiting were treated and resolved. The summary lists several problems, including AKI, nausea/vomiting with hypotension, diabetes management, and heart failure, but does not mention viral gastroenteritis. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' as the principal diagnosis at discharge. While the patient presented with nausea/vomiting and AKI, the text only states that \\'initial concerns for infection were ruled out\\' without specifying a confirmed viral etiology. Problem #2 (Nausea/Vomiting with Hypotension) lists resolution of symptoms but does not document a causative diagnosis. No references to stool studies, viral testing, or clinical synonyms for viral gastroenteritis (e.g., \\'viral enteritis,\\' \\'norovirus\\') appear in the summary. The discharge plan focuses on AKI management and medication adjustments without addressing a gastrointestinal infection diagnosis.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 15, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily stopped when the patient initially came to the hospital.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of stopping tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone during the hospital stay. While the summary does mention holding certain medications (specifically Entresto and allopurinol) and refers to holding \\'nephrotoxic medications\\' in general under the AKI section, it does not specifically state that immunosuppressant medications were stopped. Given that this is a transplant patient, such an important intervention would likely have been explicitly documented if it occurred. The only medication changes clearly documented are: 1) holding Entresto, 2) holding allopurinol, and 3) modifications to the insulin regimen. Even though holding immunosuppressants might seem clinically relevant in a transplant patient with AKI, we cannot assume this intervention occurred without explicit documentation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact that \\'Immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily stopped when the patient initially came to the hospital\\' is mentioned, I will review the provided hospital course summary. The summary includes sections on the patient\\'s history, hospital course, and specific problems addressed during the hospitalization. I will look for any mention of immunosuppressant medications and their management during the hospital stay. Upon reviewing the \\'Problem Based Summary\\' and \\'Relevant Medical History\\' sections, I notice that the patient has a history of kidney transplant and is likely on immunosuppressants. However, there is no explicit mention of tacrolimus, mycophenolate, or prednisone being temporarily stopped upon admission in any of the sections, including the \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' or \\'Problem Based Summary\\'. The closest relevant information is that \\'nephrotoxic medications\\' were held under \\'Problem #1: Acute Kidney Injury\\', but this does not explicitly state that immunosuppressants were stopped.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states under Problem #1 (Acute Kidney Injury) that \\'nephrotoxic medications\\' were held. While tacrolimus and mycophenolate are nephrotoxic and part of a standard transplant regimen, the summary does not explicitly name these medications or prednisone as being stopped. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section mentions holding Entresto and restarting allopurinol but does not reference immunosuppressants. Though clinicians might infer these medications were paused given the context, the fact is not explicitly stated in verbatim, paraphrased, or abbreviated form in the provided text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 16, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Diffuse supratentorial brain metastases with extensive vasogenic edema in bilateral parietal and occipital lobes, right greater than left, were diagnosed on MRI.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'diffuse supratentorial metastatic disease with extensive vasogenic edema\\' and specifies a \\'dominant 3.4cm right occipital lesion.\\' However, it does not explicitly state involvement of the bilateral parietal lobes or use the phrase \\'right greater than left\\' to compare bilateral occipital involvement. While \\'supratentorial\\' anatomically includes parietal and occipital regions, the summary only directly references the occipital lobe (right side) and does not confirm bilateral parietal involvement or a right left comparison across both lobes. The absence of these specific anatomical details means the fact as stated is not fully captured.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 17, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Corneal ulcers and conjunctivitis requiring topical antibiotics and antifungals (vancomycin, tobramycin, and natamycin)\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions bilateral corneal ulcers and lists the specific medications vancomycin, tobramycin, and natamycin under therapeutic procedures for Problem #2. However, conjunctivitis is not mentioned anywhere in the document. While the required medications (antibiotics/antifungals) are present, the corneal ulcer treatment is clearly documented, and conjunctivitis is absent. The fact requires both conditions to be mentioned, but only corneal ulcers are addressed. Therefore, the full statement about \\'corneal ulcers and conjunctivitis requiring...\\' is not fully present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 17, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, coupled with ketosis secondary to probable starvation and alcohol use\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions the patient\\'s initial potassium (K+) level as 2.6 and magnesium (Mg) level as 1.6, indicating hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, respectively. Under \\'Problem #3: Electrolyte Abnormalities,\\' it is stated that the patient had these abnormalities and received IV and oral electrolyte repletion. The context implies that these electrolyte imbalances were likely related to the patient\\'s condition, which includes alcohol use disorder. Ketosis is not directly mentioned, but the presence of \\'ketosis secondary to probable starvation and alcohol use\\' can be inferred as a plausible condition given the patient\\'s history of alcohol use disorder and the fact that the patient was managed with thiamine, a common treatment to prevent Wernicke\\'s encephalopathy in malnourished alcoholic patients who may have ketosis due to starvation. However, \\'ketosis\\' is not explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly states \\'Initial K+ 2.6, Mg 1.6\\' under Problem #3, confirming hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. 2. The phrase \\'ketosis secondary to probable starvation and alcohol use\\' is not present. While alcohol use is documented throughout, there is no mention of ketosis (no references to ketones, anion gap, or acid base status) or starvation. 3. Though electrolyte abnormalities in alcohol use disorder often correlate with nutritional deficits, the explicit connection to starvation induced ketosis is missing. The text meets criteria for hypokalemia/hypomagnesemia but not the full triad with ketosis etiology.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly states \\'persistent intermittent fevers\\' under Problem #1, satisfying the \\'persistent fever\\' component. 2. While pulmonary evaluation was performed (CXR showing atelectasis) and a CT chest is pending, there is no explicit mention of \\'suspected pulmonary infection\\' in the text. The differential for fever includes infection but is not localized to pulmonary. 3. Negative infectious workups are clearly documented (blood cultures, UA, CT A/P, procalcitonin). While pulmonary imaging findings are present, the absence of explicit suspicion for pulmonary infection (vs. atelectasis or other causes) meets the threshold for 0 per guidelines requiring equivalent phrasing.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 18, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'Initial AKI resolved\\' under Problem #3: Electrolyte Abnormalities, indicating that the patient had an acute kidney injury that resolved. It also mentions \\'persistent hypokalemia\\' and \\'ongoing mild hypokalemia\\', showing that hypokalemia was present during the admission, although it does not explicitly state that it resolved. However, the presence of \\'Initial AKI resolved\\' directly supports the fact that there was an acute kidney injury that resolved. The mention of \\'persistent hypokalemia\\' and \\'ongoing mild hypokalemia\\' indicates that hypokalemia was not fully resolved by the end of the admission, but it was being managed with KCl supplementation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed Problem #3: Electrolyte Abnormalities section. 2. Found explicit mention of \\'Initial AKI resolved\\' under Key Findings. 3. Identified \\'Persistent hypokalemia (K 3.3 3.4)\\' in the same section. 4. Current Clinical Status states \\'Creatinine normalized\\' (confirming AKI resolution) and \\'Ongoing mild hypokalemia\\' (showing hypokalemia persists). 5. The combination of resolved AKI with unresolved hypokalemia means the full fact \\'AKI with hypokalemia resolved\\' is not explicitly stated. While AKI resolution is documented, the hypokalemia component remains active.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 19, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis).\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze this step by step: 1. The summary mentions bilateral hydronephrosis in the CT A/P findings 2. The summary confirms UTIs with: Current infection with E. Faecalis Medical history mentions \\'prior ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella\\' 3. However, while the components are partially present, the specific relationship between hydronephrosis being complicated by these specific UTIs is not explicitly stated 4. The summary presents these as separate findings rather than establishing a clear causal or complicating relationship 5. Additionally, while current E. Faecalis and historical ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella are mentioned, they are not explicitly tied together as concurrent or related infections 6. The temporal relationship and direct connection between the hydronephrosis and these specific infections is not clearly established in the text\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions bilateral hydronephrosis (under Problem #1\\'s CT findings) and documents a history of recurrent UTIs with ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella (in Relevant Medical History), as well as a current UTI with E. Faecalis. However, the summary does not explicitly state that hydronephrosis is \\'complicated by\\' these infections. While both conditions are present, the causal or complicating relationship between hydronephrosis and the specific pathogens (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, E. faecalis) is not directly articulated. The absence of a clear link (e.g., \\'hydronephrosis complicated by...\\' or equivalent phrasing means the fact is not explicitly stated, even though all components exist separately in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 19, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Chronic opioid use and opioid-related constipation. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact about chronic opioid use and opioid related constipation is partially mentioned but not completely. Let\\'s break down the analysis: 1. Chronic opioid use is explicitly mentioned in Problem #2: Chronic Pain/Opioid Use, which notes: Multiple opioid prescriptions from different providers Currently obtaining medications from street PO hydromorphone use during admission 2. However, opioid related constipation is not mentioned anywhere in the hospital course summary: No discussion of bowel movements No mention of constipation as a symptom or problem No documentation of constipation management While chronic opioid use is clearly documented, the specific complication of opioid related constipation is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, we cannot confirm the complete fact is present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'Chronic Pain/Opioid Use\\' under Problem #2. It details the patient\\'s multiple opioid prescriptions from different providers and the current practice of obtaining medications from the street. The summary also mentions the use of PO hydromorphone 2mg q6h PRN for pain control. However, it does not explicitly mention \\'opioid related constipation\\'. The presence of chronic opioid use is clearly stated, but the related issue of constipation is not mentioned anywhere in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'Chronic Pain/Opioid Use\\' as Problem #2, detailing \\'multiple opioid prescriptions from different providers\\' and current street opioid use. This confirms chronic opioid use. 2. The summary does not mention constipation in any section. While opioid related constipation is a common complication, there is no reference to bowel issues, gastrointestinal symptoms, or constipation management in the document. 3. The absence of any mention of constipation (even as a synonym like \\'ileus\\' or \\'bowel dysfunction\\') or related interventions (e.g., laxatives) specifically tied to opioids meets the criteria for 0, as the fact is not explicitly stated or implied through clinical equivalents.\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 20, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** HHT with new PE/DVT s/p IVC filter placement as well as changed to fondaparinux\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze this step by step: 1. The fact mentions HHT with new PE/DVT This is clearly mentioned in both the one liner and brief description, indicating the patient has HHT and was admitted in March 2023 with PE/DVT. 2. IVC filter placement This is explicitly mentioned multiple times, including in the surgical history (5/13/23) and under Problem #1. 3. Change to fondaparinux While fondaparinux is mentioned, the text indicates the patient was actually transitioned FROM fondaparinux TO apixaban, which is the opposite of what we\\'re looking for in the fact. Therefore, while most elements are present (HHT, PE/DVT, IVC filter), the medication change detail is incorrect the patient was changed FROM fondaparinux rather than TO it, making this specific fact as stated not fully accurate in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient has Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) and experienced a new PE/DVT, for which he underwent IVC filter placement. It also mentions that he was initially treated with fondaparinux before being transitioned to apixaban. The summary states: \\'Patient was initially admitted to outside hospital in March 2023 with hemoptysis and found to have PE/DVT. ... During admission, he received IVC filter placement, ... and was transitioned from fondaparinux to apixaban\\'. This indicates that the patient had HHT with new PE/DVT, underwent IVC filter placement, and was changed to fondaparinux (though it was later changed from fondaparinux to apixaban). The fact is mostly mentioned but with a slight discrepancy in the anticoagulation therapy sequence.\\n\\n\\n\\n**34. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact about \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\' is partially mentioned but not exactly as stated. Let\\'s break down the analysis: 1. \\'Worsening thrombocytopenia\\' is explicitly mentioned in both the one liner and brief description (\\'progressive thrombocytopenia\\' and \\'worsening thrombocytopenia\\'). 2. Prednisone treatment is mentioned (100mg daily), but there is no mention of a taper initiation. In fact, the summary indicates this is the initial high dose steroid treatment with plans to continue, not taper. 3. The summary shows the thrombocytopenia is being actively treated with high dose steroids with some improvement (platelet counts increasing from nadir of 42K to 82K). Since the specific detail about prednisone taper initiation is not mentioned, and this appears to be initial high dose treatment rather than a taper, we cannot consider the complete fact to be present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient was started on high dose prednisone (100mg daily) for thrombocytopenia, and there is an indication that the platelet counts are improving. Under \\'Problem #2: Thrombocytopenia\\', it is stated that the patient was \\'Started high dose prednisone (100mg daily)\\' and that the \\'Current Clinical Status: Improving platelet counts\\'. Additionally, in the \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section, it is mentioned to \\'Monitor platelet response to high dose steroids (prednisone 100mg daily)\\'. While the summary does not explicitly state \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\', it does indicate the patient was on high dose prednisone for thrombocytopenia. However, it does not mention tapering of prednisone; instead, it mentions continuing prednisone at discharge. The closest relevant information is the improvement in platelet counts on high dose steroids, suggesting that the thrombocytopenia was being treated, but there\\'s no explicit mention of a taper.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly states \\'worsening thrombocytopenia\\' in the Brief Description section under the May 2023 readmission reason. 2. For \\'s/p prednisone taper initiation\\': While high dose prednisone (100mg daily) is documented as started and continued, there is no mention of a taper (dose reduction schedule or intent to taper). The text specifies \\'started\\' and \\'continue prednisone\\' but does not describe a taper process. Since \\'taper initiation\\' implies beginning dose reduction, which is absent, this component is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**35. Patient 20, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of ordering twice weekly CBCs after discharge. While the summary discusses monitoring platelet counts and mentions thrombocytopenia as a major issue (with the last count being 82K), it does not specify any particular frequency of CBC monitoring in the post discharge plan. The follow up section lists several items including monitoring platelet response to steroids, but does not detail the specific frequency of blood tests. Even in the Problem #2 section addressing thrombocytopenia, while it mentions the need for continued monitoring, it does not specify twice weekly CBCs as part of the discharge plan.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact \\'Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary, I will systematically review the provided summary. The summary includes sections like \\'One Liner\\', \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\', \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\', and \\'Problem Based Summary\\'. I will check each section for any mention of CBCs or related laboratory tests post discharge. In the \\'Problem Based Summary\\' under \\'Problem #2: Thrombocytopenia\\', it is mentioned that the patient had improving platelet counts and was on high dose prednisone. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists \\'Monitor platelet response to high dose steroids\\', indicating a need for continued monitoring of platelet counts. However, the specific frequency of CBCs post discharge is not mentioned in any section.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** Step 1: Review \\'Discharge Plan\\' sections across all problem summaries. Step 2: Check \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' for lab monitoring instructions. Step 3: Identify any references to CBC frequency. Result: While thrombocytopenia monitoring and platelet counts are mentioned in Problem #2\\'s discharge plan and follow up, there is no explicit mention of CBC frequency (twice weekly or equivalent phrasing) in any section. The instruction to \\'monitor platelet response\\' lacks specified frequency, and follow up labs are only referenced as \\'pending copper level results\\' without CBC schedule.\\n\\n\\n\\n**36. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Analyzing the summary step by step: 1. The summary mentions multiple falls (\\'admitted after multiple falls at home\\' and \\'recurrent falls\\' listed as Problem #1) 2. While extensive workup is documented (including CT chest, telemetry monitoring, troponin trending), the summary indicates they found a clear cause for the falls a T6 compression fracture 3. This contradicts the concept of \\'unknown etiology despite extensive workup\\' since a structural cause (compression fracture) was identified 4. The summary suggests the falls led to the fracture, rather than having unexplained falls after extensive investigation 5. While multiple medical issues are present (cardiac problems, AKI, dementia), the falls are not described as being of unknown origin after workup\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary explicitly states \\'Recurrent Falls with T6 Compression Fracture\\' as Problem #1, confirming recurrent falls. 2. While the T6 fracture was identified as an injury, the text does not state that the etiology of the falls remains unknown. 3. The summary documents cardiac monitoring (NSVT episodes) and dementia as contributing factors, but does not explicitly state that a comprehensive workup failed to determine a cause. 4. Though \\'extensive workup\\' is not mentioned, key elements like telemetry, imaging, and lab trends are described, but these are framed as diagnostic findings rather than negative/equivocal results. 5. The absence of phrases like \\'unknown etiology\\' or equivalent terminology, combined with identified contributing factors (albeit not necessarily causal), means the specific fact about unexplained falls despite workup isn\\'t explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**37. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I cannot find an explicit mention that the T6 wedge compression fracture occurred before the most recent fall. The summary mentions: 1. A T6 compression fracture is noted in multiple sections 2. The patient had \\'multiple falls at home\\' 3. CT chest showed a \\'new T6 wedge compression fracture\\' 4. The use of the word \\'new\\' in describing the fracture actually suggests it may be related to the recent falls rather than predating them While the patient has a history of falls, there is no clear statement or indication that this specific fracture predated the most recent fall. In fact, the description of it as a \\'new\\' fracture suggests the opposite.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient was found to have a T6 compression fracture after multiple falls at home. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' under \\'Problem #1: Recurrent Falls with T6 Compression Fracture\\' further details that the CT chest showed a new T6 wedge compression fracture. However, it does not explicitly state whether the T6 wedge compression fracture happened before or after the most recent fall. The summary implies the fracture was associated with the falls but does not clarify the timing relative to the \\'most recent fall.\\' Despite this, the fact that it is described as \\'new\\' suggests it likely occurred during one of the falls, but it doesn\\'t directly state it happened before the most recent fall.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions a \\'T6 wedge compression fracture\\' identified via CT chest in Problem #1. However, there is no indication in the text that this fracture \\'likely happened before the most recent fall.\\' The summary states the patient was admitted \\'after multiple falls at home\\' and the fracture was found during this admission, with no temporal clarification about its origin relative to specific falls. The term \\'new\\' in \\'new T6 wedge compression fracture\\' (Problem #1) suggests it was detected in the context of the current presentation, but causality or pre existing status relative to the most recent fall is not addressed.\\n\\n\\n\\n**38. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find any explicit mention of continuing or re evaluating Augmentin therapy for a 14 day course. While the summary does mention antibiotic therapy (specifically noting Zosyn for E. coli bacteremia and stating \\'Continue antibiotics\\' in the follow up section), there is no specific reference to Augmentin or a plan to re evaluate its continuation prior to a 14 day completion. The only antibiotic related statements are general (\\'Continue antibiotics for E. coli bacteremia\\') and specific to Zosyn, but not Augmentin.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'should continue and re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, it is clear that the patient was treated with antibiotics (initially Zosyn) for E. coli bacteremia. The summary under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' mentions \\'Continue antibiotics for E. coli bacteremia.\\' However, it does not specifically mention \\'Augmentin\\' or the need to re evaluate its continuation before 14 days. The antibiotic mentioned is Zosyn, not Augmentin, and there\\'s no direct reference to re evaluating antibiotic therapy at a specific day. Thus, the specific fact about continuing and re evaluating Augmentin therapy is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states \\'Continue antibiotics for E. coli bacteremia\\' in the Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section and under Problem #1\\'s discharge plan. However, Augmentin (amoxicillin clavulanate) is never mentioned in the entire document the initial antibiotic was Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam). There is no documentation of antibiotic regimen changes, duration discussions, or specific plans to re evaluate therapy duration prior to 14 days. While continuation of antibiotics is mentioned, the specific fact regarding Augmentin continuation/re evaluation before 14 days is not explicitly stated through medication name, regimen adjustment, or duration reevaluation plans.\\n\\n\\n\\n**39. Patient 22, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** patient should follow up with Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/ Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Poultsides, George, MD in in 2 weeks\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of follow up appointments with either an Advanced Practice Provider in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. The follow up section does list several items including radiation oncology appointment (1/2/24), outpatient nutrition follow up, drain output monitoring, antibiotic continuation, and swallow evaluation, but does not mention the specific follow up appointments in question. While the summary is quite detailed in other aspects of care planning, these particular follow up appointments are not documented in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed for the specific fact regarding follow up appointments with an Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Dr. Poultsides, George, MD in 2 weeks. Upon reviewing the \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section and the rest of the summary, there is no explicit mention of these follow up appointments. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists several follow up plans and appointments, such as an outpatient radiation oncology appointment, follow up with outpatient nutrition, and monitoring biliary drain output, but it does not mention the specific follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider or Dr. Poultsides.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary\\'s \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists follow up appointments for radiation oncology (1/2/24), nutrition, and swallow evaluation. The discharge plans under each problem mention continuing antibiotics, drain monitoring, and dietary support. There is no explicit mention of a follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant) in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. While other follow ups are detailed, the specific providers and timelines in question are absent from all sections of the summary, including discharge plans and follow up items.\\n\\n\\n\\n**40. Patient 23, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. The summary is broken down into several sections, including a one liner, brief description of hospital course, outstanding issues/follow up, and problem based summary. Upon reviewing the \\'One Liner\\', it mentions the patient has a history of CLL and bioprosthetic AVR/MVR, and was admitted with leukocytosis in the setting of Duvelisib therapy. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists cardiology follow up to evaluate worsening mitral stenosis and hematology follow up for CLL management. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' further details the patient\\'s CLL with leukocytosis and valvular disease, including an increased mitral valve gradient. While the summary does not explicitly state \\'in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\' in a single sentence, it clearly outlines both the progression of CLL (through leukocytosis and its management) and mitral valvulopathy (through increased mitral valve gradient and planned cardiology follow up). Therefore, the information is implicitly present across different sections, but not in a single explicit statement.\\n\\n\\n\\n**41. Patient 23, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find any explicit mention of coordinating with the Heart Failure team for transcatheter MVR or discussion of a new clinical trial drug in 4/2023. While the summary does mention: 1. Cardiology follow up is needed (specifically \\'Cardiology follow up to evaluate worsening mitral stenosis\\') 2. There is concern about the mitral valve (increased gradient from 11 to 25) 3. The need to \\'evaluate need for valve intervention\\' is listed However, the specific details about transcatheter MVR, Heart Failure team coordination, and a clinical trial drug for 4/2023 are not mentioned anywhere in the text. The follow up plans are more general and do not include these specific elements.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if the fact \\'Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary includes a section on \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' which lists \\'Cardiology follow up to evaluate worsening mitral stenosis (gradient increased from 11 to 25)\\' as a point. However, there is no mention of coordinating with the Heart Failure team or discussing a transcatheter MVR or a new clinical trial drug. The information provided in the summary does not explicitly state the fact in question, as it lacks specific details about the Heart Failure team, transcatheter MVR, or a new clinical trial drug.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions cardiology follow up to evaluate worsening mitral stenosis and the need for valve intervention (Problem #4). However, there is no mention of coordination with a Heart Failure team, transcatheter MVR, or a new clinical trial drug from 4/2023. The discharge plan for cardiology focuses on general follow up and evaluation of valve intervention needs but does not specify the involvement of a dedicated heart failure service or experimental therapies. The phrase \\'transcatheter MVR\\' and \\'clinical trial drug 4/2023\\' (or equivalents) are absent from all sections, including follow up plans and therapeutic interventions.\\n\\n\\n\\n**42. Patient 24, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions the patient\\'s diet status and advancement. In the Brief Description section, it states \\'advancement to full liquids by hospital day 2.\\' Additionally, under Problem #1 (Small Bowel Obstruction), it lists \\'Advancing to full liquid diet\\' under Current Clinical Status. However, while the diet component is clearly mentioned, there is no explicit mention of discharge with oral pain medications. The discharge plan sections mention diet advancement and supplements but do not specifically address pain management medications. Therefore, since both components of the fact (full liquid diet AND oral pain medications) must be present, and only one is mentioned, this fact is not fully present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient was \\'advancing to full liquid diet\\' under the \\'Current Clinical Status\\' section for Problem #1: Small Bowel Obstruction. Additionally, it states \\'Advance diet as tolerated\\' under the \\'Discharge Plan\\' for the same problem. While it does not explicitly mention \\'oral pain medications,\\' it does discuss various aspects of the patient\\'s management and discharge plan. The summary does mention \\'Ensure Enlive x3/day, MVI, and thiamine supplementation\\' under the discharge plan for malnutrition, indicating some form of oral medication/supplementation at discharge. However, specific \\'oral pain medications\\' are not directly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The \\'full liquid diet\\' component is explicitly mentioned in multiple sections: Brief Description states \\'advancement to full liquids by hospital day 2\\' Problem #1\\'s Current Clinical Status notes \\'Advancing to full liquid diet\\' 2. The \\'oral pain medications\\' component is not mentioned anywhere in the document. While abdominal pain is listed as an admission reason and the patient improved clinically, there is no reference to pain medication in: Therapeutic Procedures Discharge Plans Medications at discharge (only Ensure Enlive/MVI/thiamine are listed) 3. The combination requirement of both elements is not met. Though the diet component is clearly documented, the absence of any mention of pain medications (even in the discharge plan or medication lists) means the full fact is not stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**43. Patient 25, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step: 1. The fact mentions specific details about an Upper GI series and subsequent GI consultation/management plan 2. In the hospital course summary: The Upper GI series is mentioned, but with less detail (only states \\'showed no evidence of obstruction\\') There is mention of PPI therapy for 8 weeks in the discharge plan Future ERCP is mentioned in follow up However, the specific details about GI consultation (both general and advanced GI), the switch from famotidine to PPI, and the specific recommendation for outpatient ERCP evaluation are not explicitly stated 3. While some elements overlap (Upper GI series results, PPI therapy, future ERCP consideration), the complete sequence of events and specific consultation details are not fully present in the summary 4. The summary provides a more condensed version of events without the granular details about medication changes and consultation specifics\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. The summary mentions that the \\'Upper GI series showed no evidence of obstruction\\' under Problem #2: Gastric Distention/Duodenitis, which aligns with part of the given fact. However, the specific details about IV famotidine, switching to PPI BID, and discussions with GI specialists are not directly stated in the summary. The summary does mention \\'PPI therapy for 8 weeks\\' under Problem #2 and \\'Follow up with GI Oncology regarding potential future ERCP for CBD dilation\\' under Outstanding Issues/Follow Up, which partially corroborates the fact. Despite some details being present, the entire fact is not explicitly mentioned verbatim or in its entirety.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Upper GI series result: The summary explicitly states \\'Upper GI series showing mucosal thickening but no obstruction\\' under Problem #2. While \\'gastric outlet obstruction\\' isn\\'t specifically named, \\'no obstruction\\' in this context (duodenitis evaluation) is a clear clinical synonym. 2. IV famotidine/PPI transition: The summary only mentions \\'PPI therapy for 8 weeks\\' in discharge plans, with no reference to IV famotidine initiation or a transition to PPI. 3. GI consultation & ERCP deferral: The summary notes \\'follow up with GI Oncology regarding potential ERCP\\' but does not explicitly state that general/advanced GI teams deferred EGD/ERCP during hospitalization. While key elements (no obstruction, PPI course, outpatient ERCP plan) are present, critical components (famotidine use, explicit GI team deferral) are missing. A busy physician would recognize partial alignment but note missing specifics.\\n\\n\\n\\n**44. Patient 25, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) on admission or its treatment with fluids. The summary details several medical issues including abdominal distention/ascites, gastric distention/duodenitis, portal vein thrombosis, and neutropenia, but kidney function or renal issues are not discussed. The problem based summary breaks down each major issue encountered during the hospitalization, and while fluid management is mentioned in the context of ascites (paracentesis), there is no indication of AKI or its resolution with fluid therapy. Given that the summary appears comprehensive in listing complications and problems, the absence of any mention of AKI or kidney function suggests this was not a significant issue during the admission.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary is analyzed for the presence of the fact \\'AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved\\'. The summary is broken down into sections, and each is reviewed for relevant information. The \\'One Liner\\' provides an initial patient profile but does not mention AKI. The \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' details the patient\\'s admission and treatment but does not explicitly mention AKI or its treatment with fluids. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' lists key issues, including abdominal distention/ascites, gastric distention/duodenitis, portal vein thrombosis, and neutropenia, but none of these sections mention AKI or acute kidney injury. The \\'Relevant Medical History\\' and \\'Relevant Surgical History\\' sections also do not contain any reference to AKI. Since there is no explicit mention of AKI on admission or its treatment with fluids, the fact is considered not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed all sections of the hospital course summary including problem based summaries, discharge plans, and complications. 2. Searched for terms related to AKI (acute kidney injury), renal insufficiency, creatinine changes, or fluid management for renal issues. 3. Found no mention of AKI diagnosis, serum creatinine changes, BUN elevations, or specific fluid resuscitation for renal issues. 4. Fluid management mentioned relates to ascites (paracentesis, diuretics) rather than AKI treatment. 5. The \\'resolved\\' complications section only references neutropenia, not renal issues. 6. No documentation of renal function monitoring or improvement in kidney parameters.\\n\\n\\n\\n**45. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Analyzing the text step by step: 1. The fact to look for relates to chronic mesenteric ischemia and SMA stenosis as a cause of emesis 2. In Problem #2 section, the text mentions \\'CT abdomen showing moderate SMA narrowing but no acute ischemia\\' 3. While SMA stenosis is mentioned, the text explicitly states there was \\'no acute ischemia\\' 4. The patient\\'s symptoms are attributed to \\'Acute Gastritis/Gastroparesis\\' rather than chronic mesenteric ischemia 5. The connection between the patient\\'s emesis and potential chronic mesenteric ischemia is not explicitly made in the summary 6. While SMA narrowing is present, the clinical correlation suggesting it as a cause of symptoms is not stated\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the CT abdomen showed \\'moderate SMA narrowing but no acute ischemia\\' under Problem #2: Acute Gastritis/Gastroparesis. This indicates that there is stenosis of the Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA), which is a key component of the fact in question. However, the summary does not explicitly link the patient\\'s emesis to chronic mesenteric ischemia. It discusses the patient\\'s symptoms of nausea and non bloody emesis and attributes them to acute gastritis/gastroparesis, not directly to chronic mesenteric ischemia. Therefore, while the presence of SMA narrowing is mentioned, the direct connection between emesis and chronic mesenteric ischemia due to SMA stenosis is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions in Problem #2 (Acute Gastritis/Gastroparesis) that a CT abdomen showed \\'moderate SMA narrowing but no acute ischemia.\\' While SMA stenosis is identified, the summary explicitly states there was \\'no acute ischemia\\' and attributes the symptoms (including emesis) to gastritis/gastroparesis. The text does not explicitly link the emesis to chronic mesenteric ischemia as a potential etiology, nor does it use terms like \\'chronic mesenteric ischemia\\' or equivalent phrasing. The SMA narrowing is noted as an incidental finding without clinical correlation to symptoms in the documented reasoning.\\n\\n\\n\\n**46. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient was admitted for neutropenic fever and was found to have CoNS (Coagulase Negative Staph, referring to coagulase negative staphylococci, not strep) bacteremia. The summary details the treatment involving PICC line removal and administration of antibiotics, including vancomycin and linezolid. Although the specific fact mentions \\'coagulase negative strep bacteremia,\\' the summary actually refers to \\'CoNS bacteremia,\\' which is a common abbreviation for coagulase negative staphylococci bacteremia, not streptococci. Despite this discrepancy, a busy physician might interpret \\'CoNS\\' as indicating a coagulase negative bacteremia, aligning with the fact\\'s intent if not its precise wording. The treatment details match the fact provided.\\n\\n\\n\\n**47. Patient 27, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary looking for any mention of a TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) specifically on 3/6/23. While the summary does mention a TTE was performed and showed \\'no evidence of endocarditis\\' under Problem #1, it does not specifically mention a TTE on 3/6/23, nor does it explicitly state there was no evidence of mass or vegetations. The TTE mentioned appears to have been done earlier during the admission for the workup of bacteremia. The only mention of 3/6/23 in the summary is in reference to a follow up appointment with Hematology. Therefore, while a TTE was performed during this admission, the specific fact we\\'re looking for (TTE on 3/6/23 without evidence of mass or vegetations) is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, there is a mention of \\'TTE: No evidence of endocarditis\\' under Problem #1: Neutropenic Fever with CoNS Bacteremia. Although the date \\'3/6/23\\' is mentioned in the summary under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' as a follow up date with Hematology, the TTE mentioned does not have a specific date associated with it. The term \\'TTE\\' is used, which is a common abbreviation for \\'Transthoracic Echocardiogram\\'. The absence of \\'endocarditis\\' can be reasonably interpreted as absence of vegetations, which is a key finding in endocarditis. However, \\'mass\\' is not directly addressed. Despite this, the presence of \\'TTE\\' and the finding related to \\'endocarditis\\' is a strong indication. Still, the exact date of the TTE is not specified, and \\'mass or vegetations\\' is not directly equivalent to \\'endocarditis\\', though related. The fact is not explicitly mentioned with the correct date and the exact wording.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions a TTE under Problem #1\\'s diagnostic investigations, stating \\'No evidence of endocarditis.\\' While endocarditis typically involves vegetations, and the absence of endocarditis implies no vegetations, the specific date of 3/6/23 is not associated with the TTE in the text. The follow up date of 3/6/23 is listed for Hematology, but the TTE itself lacks a documented date. Since the fact requires both the date (3/6/23) and the findings (no mass/vegetations), and the date is not explicitly tied to the TTE, the fact as stated is not fully present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**48. Patient 27, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the summary for evidence of tonsillitis diagnosis and treatment. While there is a mention of \\'mild tonsillar enlargement\\' on CT maxillofacial imaging, this finding alone does not constitute a diagnosis of tonsillitis, especially since: 1) There\\'s no mention of typical tonsillitis symptoms (sore throat, difficulty swallowing, etc.), 2) The antibiotics mentioned (Zosyn, Vancomycin, Cefepime, Linezolid) were clearly prescribed for the documented MRSA/CoNS bacteremia, not for tonsillitis, 3) The tonsillar enlargement was noted as an incidental finding during workup for neutropenic fever and sinus pain. While antibiotics were given, they were explicitly tied to treating the bacteremia, not tonsillitis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the hospital course summary explicitly mentions imaging and localizing symptoms suggestive of tonsillitis treated with antibiotics. The summary lists \\'mild tonsillar enlargement\\' on the CT maxillofacial under Problem #1: Neutropenic Fever with CoNS Bacteremia. However, it does not explicitly mention \\'tonsillitis\\' or that it was treated with antibiotics specifically for tonsillitis. The patient was treated with antibiotics, but the primary indication was CoNS bacteremia and neutropenic fever, not tonsillitis. Thus, while there is a mention of \\'mild tonsillar enlargement,\\' it is not clearly linked to being symptomatic or treated as tonsillitis with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary mentions \\'mild tonsillar enlargement\\' on CT maxillofacial imaging under Problem #1\\'s diagnostic investigations. This addresses the \\'imaging\\' component of the fact. 2. There is no mention of localizing symptoms (e.g., sore throat, dysphagia) specifically suggesting tonsillitis the documented presenting symptom was sinus pain. 3. While multiple antibiotics were used (vancomycin, cefepime, linezolid), these were explicitly directed at treating CoNS/MRSA bacteremia and neutropenic fever, not specifically targeted at tonsillitis. The tonsillar finding appears incidental in this context. 4. The combination of imaging findings with antibiotic treatment specifically for tonsillitis is not explicitly stated, meeting criteria for 0.\\n\\n\\n\\n**49. Patient 28, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if it explicitly mentions the fact \\'Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23.\\' The summary indicates the patient was admitted for biliary obstruction and hyperbilirubinemia, and underwent IR guided PTBD exchange/upsize during admission. However, the specific date \\'4/21/23\\' is not mentioned anywhere in the summary. The fact that the patient had recurrent malignant biliary obstruction and required PTBD exchange is supported by the information provided, but the exact date is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**50. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the summary for evidence that bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange and the transition to hospice. Here\\'s what I found: 1. The summary mentions PTBD exchange/upsize was performed (\\'IR guided PTBD exchange/upsize from 14Fr to 16Fr\\') 2. Regarding bilirubin response, it states there was only \\'modest improvement in bilirubin levels\\' from 16.8 to 10.8 3. The summary confirms transition to home hospice (\\'transitioned to home hospice care\\' and \\'Home hospice care initiation through Sequoia Hospice\\') However, while these elements are present, the specific causal relationship between poor bilirubin response and the decision for hospice is not explicitly stated. The transition to hospice appears to be mentioned as a separate decision after \\'palliative care consultation and family discussions\\' rather than directly linked to bilirubin non improvement.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary indicates that the patient underwent IR guided PTBD exchange/upsize during admission, which resulted in \\'modest improvement in bilirubin levels\\' as stated in the Brief Description of Hospital Course and further detailed in Problem #1: Biliary Obstruction/Hyperbilirubinemia. The bilirubin levels improved from 16.8 to 10.8. This contradicts the statement that \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange.\\' Additionally, the summary confirms that the patient and family opted to transition to home hospice care after palliative care consultation and family discussions, aligning with the second part of the fact. Therefore, the fact is not entirely accurate because it states bilirubin did not improve, whereas the summary indicates a modest improvement.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary states that after PTBD exchange/upsize, there was \\'modest improvement in bilirubin levels\\' (T.bili decreased from 16.8 to 10.8). This directly contradicts the first part of the fact (\\'Bilirubin did not improve\\'). 2. The second part of the fact (\\'pt/family opted to transition to home hospice\\') is explicitly mentioned in both the Brief Description and Discharge Plan sections. 3. While the transition to hospice occurred, the summary does NOT state that it was due to lack of bilirubin improvement. The modest improvement in bilirubin and hospice decision are presented as separate events, not causally linked. 4. Since the critical first component of the fact (no bilirubin improvement) is explicitly contradicted by the text, the full fact as phrased is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**51. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the key components of the fact against the hospital course summary: 1. Sepsis requiring antibiotics: Not explicitly mentioned. While hypotension is noted, there\\'s no clear mention of sepsis or antibiotic treatment. 2. Aggressive fluid resuscitation: This is explicitly mentioned in both the Brief Description (\\'aggressive fluid resuscitation\\') and Problem #3 (\\'IV fluid boluses, maintenance fluids\\'). 3. Delirium requiring pharmacotherapy: Delirium is explicitly mentioned in the Brief Description and Problem #2, but there\\'s no mention of pharmacotherapy for it. 4. Urinary retention requiring catheter: While low urine output is mentioned (\\'poor urine output\\' and \\'Low UOP\\'), there\\'s no explicit mention of urinary retention or catheter placement. While some elements are present (delirium, fluid resuscitation), the complete combination of all stated complications (sepsis with antibiotics, delirium with pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention with catheter) is not fully documented in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if it mentions that the hospital course was complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter. The summary indicates the patient\\'s course was complicated by delirium, which aligns with \\'delirium requiring pharmacotherapy,\\' although it doesn\\'t explicitly mention pharmacotherapy. It also mentions \\'aggressive fluid resuscitation\\' in the context of \\'poor urine output,\\' which is related to \\'urinary retention.\\' However, \\'sepsis requiring antibiotics\\' is not explicitly mentioned. The summary does mention \\'aggressive fluid resuscitation,\\' which is a part of the fact in question. The presence of delirium is confirmed, but the lack of explicit mention of pharmacotherapy for delirium and sepsis with antibiotics is noted. Urinary retention is implied by \\'poor urine output.\\'\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis: The summary mentions hypotension and aggressive fluid resuscitation but does not explicitly state \\'sepsis\\' or mention antibiotic use for infection. While cholangitis is part of the history, acute sepsis is not described in the hospital course. 2. Delirium: Explicitly mentioned as a complication, but pharmacotherapy (e.g., antipsychotics) is not documented; only \\'supportive care\\' and a sitter are noted. 3. Urinary retention: The text describes \\'poor urine output\\' and \\'low UOP\\' in the context of renal function/volume status, but \\'urinary retention\\' (mechanical obstruction) is not stated, and no urinary catheter placement is documented. While fluids were given for low UOP, this reflects prerenal azotemia management rather than retention. None of the three components (sepsis with antibiotics, delirium pharmacotherapy, urinary retention with catheter) are fully met as stated in the target fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**52. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I can confirm that the specific fact about deferring cancer management to outpatient oncology due to delirium and son\\'s wishes is implicitly referenced but not explicitly stated in the way described. The summary does mention: 1. The patient has newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma 2. The patient experienced delirium during the admission 3. Treatment decisions are noted as \\'pending when mental status improves\\' 4. Outpatient oncology follow up is planned However, the summary does not explicitly state that management was deferred specifically due to the son\\'s wishes combined with the patient\\'s delirium. While we can infer this may have been part of the decision making process, the exact reasoning and the son\\'s specific involvement in this decision is not explicitly documented in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly state that the management of the patient\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was deferred to an outpatient oncologist per the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and the patient\\'s delirium. While it is mentioned that the patient has nasopharyngeal carcinoma and that there is an outpatient oncology appointment for treatment planning, there is no direct mention of the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes being a factor in this decision. The summary does indicate that treatment decisions for nasopharyngeal carcinoma are pending, partly because the patient\\'s mental status needs to improve, which could be inferred to be related to the delirium. However, the specific reason involving the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes is not stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states that treatment planning for nasopharyngeal carcinoma was deferred to outpatient oncology (Problem #2 Discharge Plan) and mentions the patient\\'s delirium as an ongoing issue (Problem #3). However, there is no explicit mention of the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes influencing this decision. While delirium is noted as a factor requiring mental status improvement before treatment decisions, the specific involvement of the son\\'s request in deferring management is not documented. The summary attributes deferral to outpatient planning and mental status considerations alone.\\n\\n\\n\\n**53. Patient 29, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Analyzing the hospital course summary step by step: 1. Searched for mentions of oxygen requirement or respiratory issues found none explicitly mentioned 2. Searched for aspiration pneumonitis not explicitly mentioned 3. Found related information in Problem #4 about aspiration risk/dysphagia: SLP evaluation showing high aspiration risk is mentioned Patient was made strict NPO But the specific development of O2 requirement and aspiration pneumonitis is not mentioned 4. While the summary discusses aspiration risk and NPO status, it does not explicitly state that the patient developed a temporary oxygen requirement due to aspiration pneumonitis 5. The causative relationship between aspiration and oxygen needs is completely absent from the text\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary is analyzed to determine if the fact \\'Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary is broken down into sections, and each section is reviewed for relevant information. The \\'One Liner\\' and \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' sections do not mention the specific fact. However, under \\'Problem #4: Aspiration Risk/Dysphagia,\\' it is stated that \\'SLP evaluation showing high aspiration risk\\' and \\'Strict NPO status initiated.\\' While the summary does not explicitly mention \\'aspiration pneumonitis\\' or a \\'temporary O2 requirement,\\' it does confirm that the patient was made \\'strict NPO\\' by SLP due to high aspiration risk. The absence of explicit mention of \\'temporary O2 requirement\\' and \\'aspiration pneumonitis\\' means the fact is not entirely mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed the \\'Hospital Course Summary\\' section: No mention of oxygen requirement or aspiration pneumonitis. Focuses on malnutrition, PEG placement, and delirium. 2. Examined \\'Problem Based Summary\\' sections: Problem #4 (Aspiration Risk/Dysphagia) states SLP evaluation led to strict NPO status and PEG feeds No reference to oxygen requirement or pneumonitis in any problem list 3. Checked \\'Outstanding Issues\\' and \\'Relevant History\\': References to SLP follow up and NPO status exist, but no documentation of oxygen needs or pneumonitis diagnosis 4. Conclusion: While NPO status and aspiration risk are documented per SLP, the specific temporary oxygen requirement and its attribution to aspiration pneumonitis are not explicitly stated in any section.\\n\\n\\n\\n### B.

All Inconsistent Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 0, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left-sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions \\'removal of surgical drains\\' in the Brief Description section 2. This directly contradicts the Important Fact stating that a \\'Left sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\' 3. These statements cannot both be true either all drains were removed (as stated in summary) or a JP drain was left in place (as stated in fact) 4. The contradiction is clear and unambiguous\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions that \\'Patient gradually advanced diet and achieved adequate oral intake by POD 8, with removal of surgical drains and preparation for discharge.\\' This indicates that the surgical drains were removed before discharge. The Important Fact states \\'Left sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge.\\' Since the summary indicates that the drains were removed before discharge, it contradicts the fact that a JP drain was left at discharge.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' states \\'removal of surgical drains and preparation for discharge\\' (POD 8). 2. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists \\'follow up wound care and drain management\\' but does not mention an active drain being left in place. 3. The discharge plan in all problem summaries (e.g., Problem #1) refers to routine follow up without mention of retained drains. 4. The explicit statement about drain removal directly contradicts the fact that a left sided abdominal JP drain was left at discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 4, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states AKI on CKD due to urinary retention treated with Foley. 2. Summary\\'s CKD (Problem #4) explicitly states \\'Current Clinical Status: At baseline\\' with creatinine 3.64/BUN 37. 3. AKI implies acute deterioration from baseline. 4. No documentation of AKI or creatinine/BUN changes indicating acute injury in summary. 5. Foley placement is documented but linked to retention management, not AKI treatment.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states the patient was discharged on Levemir 16 units BID (twice daily) 2. The fact states insulin was changed to Lantus 15 units twice daily 3. These are different insulins (Levemir vs Lantus) and different doses (16 vs 15 units) 4. Both statements cannot be true simultaneously as they represent different discharge insulin regimens\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient\\'s insulin was changed to Lantus 15 units twice a day. The Hospital Course Summary under Problem #3: Type 1 Diabetes states that the discharge plan for insulin was Levemir 16 units BID, not Lantus.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states insulin was changed to Lantus 15 units twice daily. 2. The Hospital Course Summary for Problem #3 (Type 1 Diabetes) specifies discharge plan as Levemir 16 units BID. 3. Lantus (insulin glargine) and Levemir (insulin detemir) are different long acting insulins. 4. Using Levemir instead of Lantus directly conflicts with the stated insulin change in the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 6, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Vitamin D deficiency, started on replacement, fat soluble vitamins sent, need to follow-up \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'fat soluble vitamins sent\\', implying initiation of supplementation. 2. The Hospital Summary under \\'Outstanding Issues\\' specifies \\'Continue vitamin D replacement\\' but doesn\\'t mention other fat soluble vitamins. 3. While a malabsorption workup is pending, the absence of documentation about initiating other fat soluble vitamins creates a conflict with the fact\\'s assertion that they were \\'sent\\'. 4. Vitamin D is one fat soluble vitamin, but the plural \\'vitamins\\' in the fact suggests others were addressed, which the summary lacks.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 7, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left renal cell carcinoma status-post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post-op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\' for renal cell carcinoma. 2. Hospital Summary describes surgical management (nephrectomy/IVC thrombectomy) but never mentions neoadjuvant chemotherapy in: One Liner admission reason Problem #1 therapeutic procedures Relevant Medical History 3. Follow up mentions immunotherapy resumption but not chemotherapy. 4. Absence of neoadjuvant chemo reference creates direct contradiction with the stated fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 7, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second-line\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states patient had hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib. 2. Summary\\'s \\'Outstanding Issues\\' under Problem #1 explicitly mentions \\'Follow up with primary oncology team regarding resumption of immunotherapy\\' (ipi/nivo). 3. Resuming immunotherapy after a hypersensitivity reaction requiring discontinuation contradicts the fact. 4. No mention of cabozantinib in discharge plan or current therapy.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 7, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Continued on apixaban post-op\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions restarting apixaban (Eliquis) in the Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section, indicating it was not continued during the hospital stay 2. This is consistent with typical practice of holding anticoagulation during major surgery and restarting it post discharge 3. Since the summary indicates apixaban needs to be restarted, this directly contradicts the fact stating it was continued post op\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'Continued on apixaban post op\\' implying uninterrupted use. 2. The Hospital Summary\\'s \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section explicitly states \\'Restart home apixaban\\', indicating it was held perioperatively. 3. These two statements conflict because \\'continued\\' implies no interruption, while \\'restart\\' confirms a discontinuation occurred.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 8, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Down\\'s syndrome, neurogenic bladder, admitted for pneumonia, treated with CAP regimen and vancomycin due to positive sputum culture for MRSA\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states sputum culture was positive for MRSA 2. Hospital Summary reports sputum culture grew Staphylococcus aureus (no MRSA specified) 3. Vancomycin addition attributed to MRSA nasal swab in summary 4. Discrepancy exists between MRSA source (sputum in fact vs nasal in summary)\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by discharge\\'. 2. Hospital summary explicitly states \\'sputum culture: 1+ Staphylococcus aureus\\' (a specific GPC speciation). 3. Identification of Staphylococcus aureus in sputum culture constitutes completed speciation, directly contradicting the \\'speciation not complete\\' claim. 4. No mention of aspiration event in summary, but the speciation conflict alone creates irreconcilable contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary indicates patient was treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn, later continued on Zosyn alone, while the fact states patient was on Cipro 2. The summary does not mention finasteride initiation which is stated in the fact 3. The antibiotic course details (duration, specific discharge antibiotic) are not specified in the summary, just mentions \\'Complete antibiotic course based on sensitivities\\' 4. While both mention sepsis from urinary source/pyelonephritis, they differ in the specific treatment approach\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn initially, later continued on Zosyn alone, and was to complete the antibiotic course based on sensitivities upon discharge. The Important Fact states that the patient was finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge. The summary does not mention cipro, indicating a potential contradiction. However, it is possible that \\'cipro\\' was used after discharge as part of the \\'complete antibiotic course based on sensitivities.\\' The summary does mention starting finasteride to prevent future UTIs, aligning with the Important Fact. The key contradiction lies in the antibiotic used: the summary implies Zosyn (and potentially other antibiotics) were used during the hospital stay, while the fact mentions cipro. This discrepancy suggests the summary and fact are inconsistent regarding the antibiotic treatment.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states patient was finishing a 7 day cipro course at discharge, but Hospital Summary specifies treatment with Vancomycin/Zosyn and plans to adjust antibiotics based on pending sensitivities (no cipro mentioned). 2. Important Fact notes finasteride was started to prevent UTIs, but Summary\\'s discharge plans/medications list no mention of finasteride initiation. 3. Both antibiotic regimen discrepancy and missing finasteride prescription create irreconcilable contradictions.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 12, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient sent to the hospital from home for symptoms of tachycardia, hypotension, found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula\\n\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The Important Fact states patient was sent from home with symptoms and \\'found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary indicates this was a known condition specifically mentions \\'history of... gallbladder enteric fistula\\' in the one liner 3. The summary discusses the fistula as a pre existing condition that was being monitored, not as a new finding during this admission 4. CT findings mentioned only show \\'fluid collection around gallbladder without clear fistula visualization\\' rather than discovery of a new fistula\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'new gallbladder enteric fistula\\' was found. 2. Hospital summary lists \\'gallbladder enteric fistula\\' under Relevant Medical History as a pre existing condition. 3. CT during admission showed \\'persistent fluid collection around gallbladder without clear fistula visualization\\'. 4. Summary describes it as a chronic issue requiring follow up, not a new finding. Conflict exists between \\'new\\' in fact vs pre existing in summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'unremarkable post operative course\\' but the Hospital Course Summary describes several significant post operative complications: Pain management challenges requiring ketamine and lidocaine drips Development of coccyx blistering/skin reaction Episodes of hypertension with BP elevations up to 202/114 2. These complications required special interventions and monitoring, making the post operative course notably remarkable rather than unremarkable. 3. The presence of multiple \\'Outstanding Issues\\' at discharge further confirms this was not an unremarkable course.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient had a postoperative course \\'notable for pain management challenges, development of coccyx blistering/skin reaction, and episodes of hypertension,\\' which contradicts the Important Fact stating the patient had an \\'unremarkable post operative course.\\' The presence of pain management challenges, coccyx blistering/skin reaction, and episodes of hypertension are significant postoperative complications, making the postoperative course remarkable rather than unremarkable.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'unremarkable post operative course\\'. 2. Summary describes postoperative course as \\'notable for pain management challenges requiring ketamine and lidocaine drips, development of coccyx blistering/skin reaction, and episodes of hypertension\\'. 3. These complications (IV pain management needs, skin reactions, hypertensive episodes) contradict the characterization of \\'unremarkable\\' postoperative course.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 13, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt has significant mental health history including anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder and did have a panic attack while admitted \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary is consistent with part of the fact it acknowledges bipolar disorder and PTSD in both the one liner and medical history. 2. However, it omits anxiety and borderline personality disorder from the patient\\'s mental health history. 3. Most importantly, the summary does not mention any panic attack during admission, which is a key element stated in the fact. 4. While the summary discusses pain management and hypertension issues, it makes no reference to any psychiatric events during the hospital stay. 5. Since the fact specifically states a panic attack occurred during admission, and this significant event is completely absent from what appears to be a comprehensive summary, there is a clear contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary indicates diabetes management was a concern with \\'elevated glucose readings\\' listed under Outstanding Issues/Follow Up 2. This suggests the patient\\'s diabetes was not well controlled during the perioperative period 3. Since this directly contradicts the Important Fact stating diabetes was not worsened perioperatively, we must flag this as inconsistent 4. The specific mention of \\'Diabetes management with elevated glucose readings\\' as an outstanding issue implies the condition required additional attention due to perioperative deterioration\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions \\'Diabetes management with elevated glucose readings\\' under Outstanding Issues/Follow Up, indicating that the patient\\'s type 2 diabetes was not well controlled postoperatively. This contradicts the Important Fact that states \\'It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively.\\' The presence of elevated glucose readings suggests that DM2 was indeed affected perioperatively.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states DM2 was not worsened perioperatively. 2. The Hospital Course Summary lists \\'Diabetes management with elevated glucose readings\\' under Outstanding Issues. 3. Elevated glucose readings indicate worsened glycemic control during the perioperative period. 4. These two statements cannot both be true as elevated glucose requiring management directly contradicts the claim that DM2 wasn\\'t worsened.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 14, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Dexamethasone taper was started\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states dexamethasone taper was started 2. Hospital summary under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' specifies \\'Continue dexamethasone 4mg BID with planned taper\\' 3. Problem #1 discharge plan states \\'Transition to oral dexamethasone with planned taper\\' 4. Both summary entries indicate a taper is planned but not yet initiated, maintaining current 4mg BID dose 5. No documentation of actual dose reduction occurring during hospitalization\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis. 2. The Hospital Course Summary states \\'Initial concerns for infection were ruled out\\' in the Brief Description. 3. Viral gastroenteritis is an infectious etiology, which directly conflicts with the summary\\'s statement that infection was excluded. 4. No alternative non infectious cause for nausea/vomiting is documented, but the explicit exclusion of infection contradicts the infectious diagnosis.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'suspected pulmonary infection\\' despite negative workups. 2. Summary\\'s CXR showed atelectasis, not infection; procalcitonin low (0.09). 3. Blood cultures, UA, CT A/P negative. 4. Summary lists \\'Fever/Possible Infection\\' but no evidence of pulmonary source. 5. Pending CT chest suggests ongoing evaluation, but current data do not support pulmonary infection. Thus, summary contradicts the fact\\'s assertion of suspected pulmonary infection.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 18, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma recently complicated by progression to CNS lymphoma\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma\\' while Hospital Summary specifies \\'high grade B cell lymphoma with MYC/BCL2 translocations\\' in both the One Liner and Relevant Medical History. These are distinct diagnostic entities (DLBCL vs. high grade B cell lymphoma with double hit genetics). 2. Both sources agree on CNS progression. 3. The lymphoma subtype discrepancy creates a direct contradiction since they cannot coexist as primary diagnoses.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 18, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary directly addresses both AKI and hypokalemia 2. Under \\'Problem #3: Electrolyte Abnormalities\\', it states: \\'Initial AKI resolved\\' \\'Persistent hypokalemia (K 3.3 3.4)\\' and \\'Ongoing mild hypokalemia\\' 3. The Important Fact states AKI and hypokalemia resolved, but the summary indicates only AKI resolved while hypokalemia persisted 4. This is a clear contradiction regarding the resolution of hypokalemia\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that \\'Initial AKI resolved\\' and \\'Creatinine normalized\\', which is consistent with the Important Fact that \\'Acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved during admission\\'. However, it also mentions \\'Persistent hypokalemia\\' and \\'Ongoing mild hypokalemia\\', indicating that hypokalemia did not resolve. This contradicts the Important Fact that hypokalemia resolved during admission.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'acute kidney injury with hypokalemia resolved\\'. 2. Summary under Problem #3 states \\'Initial AKI resolved\\' (consistent) but specifies \\'persistent hypokalemia (K 3.3 3.4)\\' and \\'ongoing mild hypokalemia\\'. 3. Hypokalemia persistence directly contradicts the claim of resolved hypokalemia in the fact. 4. Both conditions must resolve for consistency; unresolved hypokalemia creates contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 19, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis).\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions bilateral hydronephrosis on CT A/P 2. The summary notes only one current UTI organism (E. Faecalis) 3. While the medical history mentions prior ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella infections, these are not active/current 4. The current infection pattern (single organism) differs from the fact\\'s claim of concurrent infections with three organisms 5. The treatment (Augmentin) is inconsistent with managing concurrent ESBL organisms, which typically require broader spectrum antibiotics\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 20, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** HHT with new PE/DVT s/p IVC filter placement as well as changed to fondaparinux\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary is consistent with the fact about HHT, PE/DVT, and IVC filter placement 2. The summary mentions the patient was initially on fondaparinux 3. However, rather than staying on fondaparinux, the summary states the patient was \\'transitioned from fondaparinux to apixaban\\' 4. This change in medication represents a different final outcome than stated in the fact (which indicates the patient was changed to fondaparinux) 5. Since these different medication endpoints cannot both be true, this represents a clear contradiction\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states the patient was changed to fondaparinux after IVC filter placement. However, the Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was transitioned from fondaparinux to apixaban.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states anticoagulation was changed to fondaparinux 2. Hospital summary explicitly states \\'transitioned from fondaparinux to apixaban\\' 3. These two statements are mutually exclusive regarding anticoagulation management\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\'. 2. Hospital summary under Problem #2 notes \\'improving platelet counts (last 82K)\\' after starting high dose prednisone (100mg daily). 3. Discharge plan specifies \\'continue prednisone\\' with no mention of tapering. 4. Summary documents platelet improvement with steroid initiation, contradicting the assertion of worsening after taper initiation.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary identifies clear causes for the falls: T6 compression fracture was found Patient has multiple contributing conditions (HFrEF, SSS, dementia) Episodes of NSVT were documented 2. The workup was thorough and revealed findings: CT chest showing compression fracture Cardiac telemetry showing NSVT Lab work showing AKI 3. This contradicts the fact stating falls were of \\'unknown etiology despite extensive workup\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states \\'CT chest showing new T6 wedge compression fracture\\' 2. This directly contradicts the fact that the T6 fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall\\' 3. The use of \\'new\\' in the summary implies the fracture occurred with the recent falls, not before them 4. This temporal discrepancy creates a clear contradiction between the summary and the important fact\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states the T6 fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall.\\' 2. The Hospital Summary states CT chest showed \\'new T6 wedge compression fracture\\' under Problem #1. 3. The term \\'new\\' in the summary implies the fracture occurred during/after the recent fall episode, directly conflicting with the Important Fact\\'s timeline. 4. These two statements cannot both be true simultaneously.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'should continue and re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\'. 2. Hospital summary documents treatment with Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam) for E. coli bacteremia, not Augmentin (amoxicillin clavulanate). 3. Discharge plan states \\'Continue antibiotics\\' without mentioning Augmentin or planned re evaluation before 14 days. 4. Use of different antibiotic (Zosyn) and lack of Augmentin related plan directly conflict with the fact\\'s requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 22, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** patient should follow up with Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/ Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Poultsides, George, MD in in 2 weeks\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact specifies follow up with APP in 1 week and Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. 2. Hospital Course Summary\\'s \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists radiation oncology, nutrition, drain monitoring, antibiotics, and swallow evaluation but no mention of APP or Dr. Poultsides follow ups. 3. No documentation of these specific provider follow ups in any section of the summary. 4. Omission creates direct conflict as these appointments are required per the fact but absent in discharge planning.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 23, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** large pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'large pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis\\' (implying persistent large effusion after drainage). 2. Hospital summary documents \\'improved but persistent moderate effusion\\' after thoracentesis in both the Brief Description and Problem #2 sections. 3. \\'Moderate\\' post procedure effusion directly contradicts the \\'large\\' effusion claimed in the fact after thoracentesis.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient had CoNS (Coagulase Negative Staphylococci) bacteremia, not coagulase negative strep bacteremia. CoNS and coagulase negative strep are different organisms, thus the summary contradicts the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states bacteremia was caused by coagulase negative strep (CoNS). 2. Hospital Summary\\'s Problem #1 explicitly lists CoNS bacteremia in blood cultures. 3. However, the One Liner header states \\'MRSA bacteremia\\' which is a different organism. 4. MRSA (methicillin resistant S. aureus) and CoNS are mutually exclusive bacteremia causes. 5. This creates direct contradiction between header and problem details within the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 27, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions tonsillar enlargement on CT maxillofacial, which is consistent with possible tonsillitis. 2. However, the summary indicates that the primary infection was CoNS bacteremia related to PICC line, not tonsillitis. 3. While antibiotics were given (Zosyn, Vancomycin, Cefepime), they were primarily for treating the bacteremia, not specifically for tonsillitis. 4. The important fact states tonsillitis was the main diagnosis and reason for antibiotics, which contradicts the hospital course that clearly attributes the infection and antibiotic treatment to PICC line associated CoNS bacteremia.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'Imaging...suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\' 2. Hospital summary\\'s CT shows \\'mild tonsillar enlargement\\' but attributes antibiotic use to CoNS bacteremia treatment (vancomycin/cefepime/linezolid). 3. No documentation of tonsillitis diagnosis or targeted treatment in the summary. 4. Antibiotics were given for bacteremia, not explicitly for tonsillar findings, creating a contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states bilirubin showed \\'modest improvement\\' (from 16.8 to 10.8) after PTBD exchange/upsize 2. The Important Fact states bilirubin \\'did not improve despite PTBD exchange\\' 3. These statements directly contradict each other one claims improvement while the other explicitly states no improvement 4. Both summaries agree on the transition to hospice, but the contradiction regarding bilirubin response is clear\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that the patient underwent IR guided PTBD exchange/upsize during admission with \\'modest improvement in bilirubin levels.\\' The bilirubin levels improved from 16.8 to 10.8. This contradicts the Important Fact that \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange.\\' The summary clearly indicates an improvement in bilirubin levels, so the summary is inconsistent with the fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange. 2. Hospital Summary under Problem #1 shows T.bili improved from 16.8 (peaked 17.6) to 10.8 after PTBD exchange/upsize. 3. These are conflicting statements about bilirubin response to intervention. 4. Both cannot be true simultaneously.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions that the patient\\'s course was complicated by delirium and poor urine output despite aggressive fluid resuscitation. The Important Fact states that the hospital course was complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter. The summary does not mention sepsis or the use of antibiotics, nor does it mention urinary retention or the use of a urinary catheter. The presence of sepsis and urinary retention with specific treatments (antibiotics and urinary catheter) in the Important Fact contradicts the summary, which does not mention these.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states sepsis required antibiotics not mentioned in summary. 2. Delirium management in summary lists supportive care/sitter (no pharmacotherapy as per fact). 3. Urinary retention/catheter in fact vs. summary documents low UOP attributed to renal function without catheter mention. These specific discrepancies create contradictions.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Presence of important facts\\n\\n**Score: 50/100** (95% CI: 40-60) (higher values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the important facts missing:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries frequently omit critical clinical details due to recurring patterns: (1) **Incomplete procedural documentation** (e.g., Patient 0’s left JP drain status contradicted by \"drains removed,\" Patient 2’s omitted adhesion takedown despite noting bowel resection); (2) **Missing quantitative data** (e.g., Patient 0’s hemoglobin 8.8, Patient 17’s hypomagnesemia); (3) **Unspecified etiology/timing** (e.g., Patient 3’s LLQ pain not localized to cancer, Patient 21’s T6 fracture timing relative to falls); (4) **Implicit recovery milestones** (e.g., Patient 2’s lack of flatus/bowel movement documentation despite \"recovered well\"); (5) **Medication ambiguities** (e.g., Patient 6’s insulin regimen change to Lantus 15U BID vs. documented Levemir 16U BID; Patient 16’s absent Bactrim prophylaxis despite high-dose steroids); and (6) **Incomplete diagnostic links** (e.g., Patient 4’s AKI omission despite CKD/urinary retention, Patient 26’s SMA stenosis not tied to emesis). These omissions often arise from overgeneralization (e.g., \"anemia managed\" without labs), reliance on inference (e.g., Patient 28’s sepsis management without explicit diagnosis), or fragmented follow-up instructions (e.g., Patient 12’s TPN plan lacking 4-week specificity). Such patterns highlight systemic gaps in translating granular clinical data into structured summaries, risking care continuity.\\n\\n### B.

All Missing Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 0, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left-sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of a left sided abdominal JP drain being present at discharge. While the summary does mention drains in general (\\'patient had a wound vac and drains removed as she recovered\\' in the Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section), it actually indicates that these drains were removed during recovery, not left in place at discharge. There is no specific mention of a JP drain, its location (left sided abdominal), or its status at discharge. The discharge related information focuses on Lovenox therapy, nutritional follow up, and wound care, but does not include any information about retained drains.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if the fact \\'Left sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary was reviewed section by section. The \\'One Liner\\' and \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' sections provided an overview of the patient\\'s admission and surgery but did not mention the status of JP drains at discharge. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section listed several issues, including Lovenox therapy, nutritional follow up, and wound care and follow up, but stated that \\'drains removed as she recovered,\\' which implies that drains were not left at discharge. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' sections detailed the patient\\'s diagnosis, treatment, and recovery but did not mention JP drains. Therefore, the fact \\'Left sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states under \\'Wound care and follow up\\' that \\'the patient had a wound vac and drains removed as she recovered.\\' This indicates that drains were removed prior to discharge rather than being left in place. There is no mention of any drains (including JP drains) remaining at discharge, let alone a left sided abdominal JP drain specifically. The summary explicitly documents drain removal as part of recovery, which directly contradicts the presence of a drain being left at discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 0, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Discharged with DVT prophylaxis, with anemia at hemoglobin 8.8\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze this step by step: 1. For DVT prophylaxis: The summary mentions \\'Lovenox\\' twice once stating \\'prepared for discharge with Lovenox\\' and again under Outstanding Issues stating \\'The patient will need Lovenox on discharge and Lovenox teaching.\\' Lovenox is a common DVT prophylaxis medication. 2. For anemia with Hgb 8.8: While the summary does mention that the hospital stay was \\'complicated by... anemia, which were managed accordingly,\\' it does not specify the hemoglobin level of 8.8 or any other specific value. 3. Since both components need to be present for the fact to be considered fully mentioned, and we\\'re missing the specific hemoglobin value, we cannot say this fact is completely present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary indicates that the patient was discharged with Lovenox, which is a form of DVT prophylaxis. The summary also mentions that the patient had anemia during their hospital stay. To confirm if the anemia was at a hemoglobin level of 8.8, we need to look for specific hemoglobin values mentioned in the summary. The summary does mention that the patient had anemia, which was managed accordingly, but it does not explicitly state the hemoglobin level at discharge or during the stay. However, it does mention that the patient was prepared for discharge with Lovenox, fulfilling the first part of the fact. The presence of anemia is confirmed, but the specific hemoglobin value of 8.8 is not mentioned in the provided summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. DVT prophylaxis: The summary explicitly states the patient was discharged with Lovenox, which is a standard DVT prophylaxis medication. This fulfills the first part of the fact. 2. Anemia at hemoglobin 8.8: While anemia is mentioned as a complication that was managed, the specific hemoglobin value of 8.8 is not documented in the provided summary. No lab values for hemoglobin are referenced in any section. Conclusion: Though DVT prophylaxis is clearly mentioned, the absence of a specific hemoglobin level (8.8) means the full fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 1, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypoxia 2/2 recurrent R pleura effusion\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states that hypoxia was caused by a large, loculated right pleural effusion in multiple sections (e.g., \\'One Liner\\' and \\'Brief Description\\'). However, the term \\'recurrent\\' is not used in any part of the summary to describe the pleural effusion. While the effusion is described as \\'persistently loculated\\' after treatment, this indicates ongoing loculation rather than recurrence of a prior resolved effusion. The patient’s history includes a prior pericardial effusion, but this is a separate anatomical location. Since \\'recurrent\\' is a critical component of the specified fact and is not explicitly stated or clearly implied, the fact as phrased is not fully addressed.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 2, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed. Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, while it is mentioned that the patient underwent \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' under Problem #1, the specific details about taking down adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall and removing obstructing necrotic mass are not explicitly mentioned. The summary only states that there was a \\'necrotic small bowel mass\\' and that a \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' was performed, but does not provide the specific surgical details about adhesions or the specific steps of removing the necrotic mass. While we can infer that the necrotic mass was removed during the surgery, the specific surgical steps and findings regarding adhesions are not explicitly documented in this summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' under therapeutic procedures for the small bowel mass, which directly matches part of the fact. The summary also references a \\'necrotic small bowel mass\\' being addressed, confirming removal of the obstructing necrotic mass. However, there is no mention of adhesions between the omentum and abdominal wall being taken down. While the resection and mass removal are clearly documented, the adhesion takedown is absent from the text. Since the fact requires both components (adhesion takedown and resection/mass removal), and one component is missing, the fact as a whole is not fully stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 2, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient recovered from surgery well; had flatus and bowel movement \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of the patient having flatus or bowel movement after surgery. While the summary indicates that the patient \\'recovered well post operatively\\' and was \\'prepared for discharge\\', these general statements of good recovery do not specifically confirm the return of bowel function. The summary discusses the laparoscopic small bowel resection and mentions that the patient was \\'recovering post operatively with no acute concerns\\', but does not provide specific details about bowel function recovery. Since return of bowel function (flatus/bowel movement) is an important post operative milestone, its absence from the detailed summary suggests it was not explicitly documented.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary indicates that the patient \\'recovered well post operatively\\' after undergoing laparoscopic small bowel resection. Under \\'Problem #1: Small Bowel Mass\\', it is stated that the patient was \\'recovering post operatively with no acute concerns\\'. However, there is no explicit mention of the patient having flatus or a bowel movement in the provided summary. The recovery is mentioned in the context of post operative status, but specific details like flatus or bowel movement are not provided.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states the patient \\'recovered well post operatively\\' in both the Brief Description and Problem #1 summary. However, there is no mention of flatus or bowel movement anywhere in the document. While bowel function recovery is implied by the absence of post operative complications, the specific indicators (flatus/bowel movement) are not explicitly documented in any section, including surgical recovery details, discharge criteria, or GI status updates. The summary focuses on broader recovery and oncologic management without detailing gastrointestinal functional milestones.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 3, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** LLQ abdominal pain 2/2 cancer\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that while abdominal pain is mentioned in Problem #3, it is not specifically described as LLQ (left lower quadrant) pain due to cancer. The summary mentions \\'Lower Back Pain/Abdominal Pain\\' and attributes it to \\'new/progressive bony disease throughout T/L spine and pelvis,\\' but does not specify LLQ location. While the patient does have sigmoid adenocarcinoma which could cause LLQ pain, the summary does not explicitly state that the patient is experiencing LLQ pain or that their abdominal pain is specifically in the left lower quadrant. The connection between the pain and cancer is present (as evidenced by palliative care involvement for symptom management), but the specific LLQ location is not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was thoroughly reviewed to determine if \\'LLQ abdominal pain 2/2 cancer\\' was explicitly mentioned. The summary lists \\'Problem #3: Lower Back Pain/Abdominal Pain\\' and mentions that imaging showed new/progressive bony disease throughout T/L spine and pelvis. However, it does not specifically state \\'LLQ abdominal pain\\' or directly attribute abdominal pain to cancer. The summary does mention that the patient has stage IV sigmoid adenocarcinoma with metastasis and that palliative care was consulted for symptom management, which includes abdominal pain. Despite this, the specific fact \\'LLQ abdominal pain 2/2 cancer\\' is not directly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'Lower Back Pain/Abdominal Pain\\' as Problem #3, attributing it to \\'new/progressive bony disease\\' in imaging. While the patient has stage IV sigmoid adenocarcinoma (a cancer typically located in the LLQ region), the summary does not explicitly state that the abdominal pain is localized to the LLQ or directly caused by the cancer itself (as opposed to bony metastases). The term \\'LLQ abdominal pain\\' or equivalent phrasing is absent, and causality (\\'2/2 cancer\\') is not explicitly documented in the context of abdominal pain.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 4, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step for the presence of AKI on CKD with urinary retention treated by foley catheter: 1. CKD is explicitly mentioned patient has CKD IV as part of their history 2. Urinary retention is explicitly mentioned multiple times it was one of the primary admission reasons 3. Foley catheter treatment is explicitly mentioned \\'Foley catheter placed\\' under CKD IV and Urinary Retention section 4. However, while CKD is mentioned, there is no explicit mention of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) or worsening kidney function. In fact, the summary specifically states \\'Kidney function likely at baseline\\' and \\'Kidney function stable\\' 5. While all other elements are present (CKD, urinary retention, and foley placement), the crucial AKI component is not mentioned, making this an incomplete match to the specific fact we\\'re looking for\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient had urinary retention, was diagnosed with CKD IV (Chronic Kidney Disease stage 4), and was treated with Foley catheter placement for urinary retention. The summary under \\'CKD IV and Urinary Retention\\' states that kidney function was \\'likely at baseline\\' and \\'stable,\\' implying that there wasn\\'t a significant acute deterioration, but it does indicate that the patient had CKD and was treated for urinary retention with a Foley catheter. However, the specific phrase \\'AKI on CKD\\' (Acute Kidney Injury on Chronic Kidney Disease) is not directly mentioned. Despite this, the information provided implies that the patient\\'s kidney function was monitored and considered stable, suggesting that any potential AKI was not significant enough to be highlighted as a separate issue. The fact that kidney function was \\'likely at baseline\\' and \\'stable\\' after treatment suggests that there was no significant acute injury. Nonetheless, the key elements of CKD, urinary retention, and treatment with a Foley catheter are all present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course mentions CKD IV (stage 4 chronic kidney disease) and urinary retention as part of the admission reason and in the \\'CKD IV and Urinary Retention\\' section. 2. The summary explicitly states a Foley catheter was placed as part of therapeutic procedures for urinary retention. 3. However, there is no mention of AKI (acute kidney injury) occurring in this context. The text specifically notes \\'kidney function likely at baseline\\' and \\'kidney function stable,\\' indicating no acute deterioration (AKI) was documented. 4. While urinary retention (cause) and Foley placement (treatment) are present, the key component of AKI superimposed on CKD is absent. The phrase \\'AKI on CKD\\' or equivalent terminology is not used, and the clinical context suggests kidney function remained stable.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient was admitted with \\'persistent hypotension due to adrenal crisis\\' and had \\'primary adrenal insufficiency\\' as part of her Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome (APS) Type 2. The summary under \\'Problem #1: Adrenal Crisis\\' details the diagnosis and treatment, indicating that the adrenal crisis was likely managed with hydrocortisone. However, the specific reason for the adrenal crisis, such as intolerance to PO prednisone, is not directly mentioned in the summary. The summary does mention that the patient was started on hydrocortisone IV and planned to be tapered to PO hydrocortisone, but it does not explicitly state that the adrenal crisis was due to intolerance of PO prednisone. Nonetheless, the key elements of adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune polyglandular syndrome are present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course explicitly states the patient has primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome (APS) Type 2 and was admitted for adrenal crisis. 2. The summary documents adrenal crisis management with IV hydrocortisone and a discharge plan to taper to oral hydrocortisone. 3. While nausea/vomiting (a potential barrier to oral intake) is noted, there is no explicit mention of prednisone use, intolerance to prednisone, or a causal link between prednisone intolerance and the crisis. The adrenal crisis etiology is attributed to the underlying APS/insufficiency, not medication intolerance. 4. The absence of any reference to prednisone (or equivalent glucocorticoid) intolerance meets the threshold for 0, as this specific component of the fact is entirely missing.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that while Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is mentioned multiple times and insulin management is discussed, the specific fact about insulin being changed to Lantus 15 units twice a day is not explicitly stated. The discharge plan mentions \\'Continue Levemir 16 UNITS BID and Insulin 1:7 TID AC\\' which is a different insulin regimen than what we\\'re looking for. The summary discusses insulin management (including transition from insulin gtt to subQ insulin), but nowhere does it mention Lantus or a 15 unit twice daily dosing schedule. Since the specific insulin type (Lantus) and dosage (15 units BID) are not mentioned, this fact is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and was managed with insulin. Under Problem #3: Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, it is stated that the patient was \\'converted to subQ insulin\\' and at discharge, was to \\'continue Levemir 16 UNITS BID and Insulin 1:7 TID AC.\\' Although the summary does not explicitly state that insulin was changed to \\'Lantus 15units twice a day,\\' it does mention a basal insulin (Levemir) being used twice a day, which is similar in concept. However, \\'Lantus\\' is not mentioned; \\'Levemir\\' is used instead, and the dosage is 16 units, not 15 units. The fact is not explicitly mentioned as it refers to a different insulin (Lantus vs Levemir) and a different dose (15 units vs 16 units).\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions under Problem #3 (T1DM) that the discharge plan includes \\'Continue Levemir 16 UNITS BID and Insulin 1:7 TID AC.\\' Levemir (insulin detemir) is a different basal insulin than Lantus (insulin glargine), and the dose specified is 16 units BID, not 15 units BID. While the summary confirms a transition to subcutaneous insulin and specifies the regimen, the specific change to Lantus 15 units BID is not mentioned. The text does not use Lantus, a synonym, or a matching dose, so the fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 6, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Vitamin D deficiency, started on replacement, fat soluble vitamins sent, need to follow-up \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary looking for explicit mentions of vitamin D deficiency, vitamin replacement, fat soluble vitamins, and related follow up. While the summary does mention vitamin testing in the Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section (\\'Vitamin levels check: A, D, E, K, zinc, selenium, and folate\\'), it does not explicitly state that: 1) The patient has vitamin D deficiency, 2) That vitamin replacement was started, or 3) That fat soluble vitamins were specifically sent. The summary only indicates that these tests were planned or in progress, but does not provide results or indicate that treatment was initiated. While there is a malabsorption workup mentioned, this alone doesn\\'t confirm vitamin D deficiency or treatment. Therefore, while related topics are mentioned, the specific fact we\\'re looking for is not explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient has Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome (APS) Type 2 and lists \\'Vitamin levels check: A, D, E, K, zinc, selenium, and folate\\' under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\'. This indicates that Vitamin D levels are to be checked, implying concern for potential deficiency. However, it does not explicitly state that the patient has a Vitamin D deficiency or that Vitamin D replacement was started. The summary does mention that fat soluble vitamins (which include Vitamin D) are part of the levels to be checked, and there\\'s a mention of \\'Malabsorption workup\\' in progress, which could be related to the need for checking these levels. The need to follow up on Vitamin D levels is explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists \\'Vitamin levels check: A, D, E, K, zinc, selenium, and folate,\\' indicating plans to assess vitamin D but does not explicitly state a deficiency was found. 2. The \\'Malabsorption workup\\' in progress suggests clinical suspicion but does not confirm malabsorption related vitamin deficiency. 3. No documentation of vitamin D replacement therapy in therapeutic interventions (hydrocortisone/levothyroxine/insulin are the only medications detailed). 4. While follow up for vitamin levels is planned, the triad of confirmed deficiency, replacement initiation, and fat soluble vitamin supplementation is not explicitly stated in any section.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 7, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left renal cell carcinoma status-post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post-op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The fact is partially mentioned but lacks the neoadjuvant chemotherapy component. Let\\'s break down the analysis: 1. Left renal cell carcinoma: Explicitly mentioned multiple times in the summary, including \\'left renal cell carcinoma\\' in the Brief Description section. 2. Post op left nephrectomy: Clearly documented as \\'left nephrectomy\\' performed with the HPB team. 3. IVC thrombectomy: Mentioned as \\'tumor thrombectomy\\' and specifically notes \\'tumor thrombus in the left renal vein and IVC\\'. 4. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: This component is NOT mentioned anywhere in the hospital course summary. There is no reference to any pre surgical chemotherapy treatment. Since the neoadjuvant chemotherapy component is a significant part of the fact we\\'re looking for and it\\'s completely absent from the text, we cannot consider the entire fact as being explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that Ms. Tysha Han has left renal cell carcinoma with tumor thrombus in the left renal vein and IVC, and that she underwent left nephrectomy and tumor thrombectomy. The summary details her post operative course and management. The fact \\'Left renal cell carcinoma status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy\\' is partially mentioned. The summary confirms the presence of left renal cell carcinoma, the surgical procedures (left nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy), but does not explicitly mention \\'neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\'. However, the key elements of left renal cell carcinoma, post op left nephrectomy, and IVC thrombectomy are present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'left renal cell carcinoma\\' and describes the surgical procedures \\'left nephrectomy\\' and \\'tumor thrombectomy\\' (with IVC involvement noted in imaging). However, there is no mention of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in any section of the document. While the nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy components of the fact are clearly stated, the neoadjuvant chemotherapy component is absent. Since the fact requires all three elements (renal cell carcinoma, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and post op nephrectomy/IVC thrombectomy) to be explicitly mentioned, the absence of neoadjuvant chemotherapy documentation results in a determination that the full fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 7, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second-line\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no mention of any hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo (ipilimumab/nivolumab) or a switch to cabozantinib as second line therapy. The summary focuses on the patient\\'s surgical management of renal cell carcinoma through left nephrectomy and tumor thrombectomy. While the patient\\'s cancer treatment is discussed, specifically in Problem #1 under \\'Malignant neoplasm of kidney, left,\\' there is no reference to any immunotherapy treatments or adverse reactions. The only treatments mentioned are the surgical intervention and post operative management. The summary includes the patient\\'s medical history and complications but does not discuss any prior or planned systemic cancer therapies.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s admission for left nephrectomy and removal of tumor thrombus due to left renal cell carcinoma. It covers the patient\\'s post operative course, including hypotension, pain control, and confusion. However, upon reviewing the summary, there is no mention of a hypersensitivity reaction to \\'ipi/nivo\\' (likely referring to ipilimumab and nivolumab, immunotherapy drugs) or a switch to \\'cabozantinib\\' as a second line treatment. The summary focuses on the surgical intervention and post operative care without referencing any specific immunotherapy or its complications.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed in detail. The key sections reviewed include: Brief Description, Outstanding Issues, Problem Based Summaries (Problems #1 3), Relevant Medical History, and Surgical History. There is any mention of immunotherapy agents ipilimumab (ipi) or nivolumab (nivo), hypersensitivity reactions, or use of cabozantinib. The cancer management described focuses solely on surgical intervention (nephrectomy/thrombectomy) without reference to systemic therapies. The post op complications (hypotension, delirium) are attributed to surgical recovery rather than drug reactions. No clinical synonyms, abbreviations, or paraphrased references to the specified fact were found in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find any explicit mention of: 1) an aspiration event prior to discharge, 2) blood cultures with 1/4 bottles positive for GPC (Gram positive cocci), or 3) pending speciation results. The summary does mention positive sputum cultures for Staphylococcus aureus and mentions that lab sensitivities are pending, but this is different from blood culture results. While the patient has risk factors for aspiration (G tube dependent, Down\\'s syndrome), no actual aspiration event is documented. The only microbiology results explicitly mentioned are: sputum culture growing Staph aureus, positive MRSA nares screen, and a dirty UA. There is no mention of blood cultures or their results anywhere in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission and treatment for community acquired pneumonia. To determine if the fact \\'Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\' is mentioned, we need to look for any reference to an aspiration event, blood culture results (since \\'bottles positive\\' typically refers to blood cultures), or Gram positive cocci (GPC). The summary does not explicitly mention any aspiration event prior to discharge. It also does not mention blood culture results or speciation. The sputum culture result is mentioned, showing growth of Staphylococcus aureus, but this does not directly relate to the fact in question. Therefore, the specific fact about a potential aspiration event and blood culture results positive for GPC is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) Reviewed all sections of the hospital course summary for mentions of aspiration events or culture results matching the fact. 2) The \\'Potential aspiration event\\' is not mentioned in any section no documentation of choking, feeding difficulties, or clinical suspicion of aspiration near discharge. 3) While sputum culture showed Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA, there\\'s no mention of \\'1/4 bottles positive for GPC\\' (gram positive cocci) in blood cultures or other specimens. 4) The outstanding urine culture in Problem #3 refers to urinary tract infection follow up, not respiratory specimens. 5) \\'Speciation not complete\\' only applies to the known S. aureus sensitivities, not to unidentified GPC. None of the three components of the target fact are explicitly documented in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the provided fact against the hospital course summary step by step: 1. Sepsis from urinary source/pyelonephritis: The summary mentions \\'complicated urinary tract infection with possible developing pyelonephritis\\' While sepsis isn\\'t explicitly stated, the presence of fever, confusion, and systemic symptoms suggests it 2. 7 day course of cipro on discharge: The summary indicates Zosyn (not Cipro) for 7 10 days This is a different antibiotic than specified in the fact 3. Started on finasteride to prevent future UTIs: Finasteride is listed in the follow up medications However, the reason for starting finasteride (prevention of future UTIs) is not explicitly stated While there are similarities (UTI with pyelonephritis, antibiotic course, and finasteride use), the specific details (Cipro vs. Zosyn, explicit mention of sepsis, stated purpose of finasteride) differ enough from what\\'s explicitly written that we cannot say this exact fact is present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission and treatment. The patient was admitted with a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) with possible developing pyelonephritis, which aligns with \\'Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis.\\' The summary indicates the patient was treated with antibiotics (Zosyn and initially Vancomycin) and showed improvement. The discharge plan includes continuing Zosyn for a total of 7 10 days, which indicates the patient was not finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge but was instead continuing Zosyn. The medication management list includes finasteride, indicating that finasteride was started, presumably in an attempt to prevent future UTIs as the patient has a history of prior UTIs and urinary incontinence.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis mention: The summary states \\'complicated urinary tract infection with possible developing pyelonephritis\\' but does not explicitly use the term \\'sepsis\\' or describe systemic inflammatory response criteria. 2. Ciprofloxacin course: The discharge plan specifies continuing Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam) for 7 10 days, not ciprofloxacin. 3. Finasteride indication: While finasteride is listed in discharge medications, no rationale linking it to UTI prevention is provided. The three key components of the fact (sepsis designation, cipro completion, and finasteride indication) are all absent from the text in any recognizable form.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 9, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Right upper extremity and left lower extremity swelling, DVT US negative, unclear etiology \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary addresses swelling in extremities and DVT ultrasounds being negative. Under Problem #4 (\\'Swelling in extremities\\'), it explicitly states that upper and lower extremity venous ultrasounds showed no DVT. However, the summary does not specify \\'right upper extremity\\' and \\'left lower extremity\\' as the affected limbs—it only refers to \\'extremities\\' generally. Additionally, while the etiology is noted as unresolved (as there are no outstanding issues listed for this problem), the phrase \\'unclear etiology\\' is not explicitly used. The absence of specific laterality and the exact phrasing \\'unclear etiology\\' means the fact as stated is not fully captured.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 10, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** The patient with polysubstance use disorder (alcohol, meth) was admitted to the hospital due to concerns for acute alcohol withdrawal and received inpatient treatment for alcohol use disorder as well as linkages to outpatient MAT treatment. \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact that \\'the patient with polysubstance use disorder (alcohol, meth) was admitted to the hospital due to concerns for acute alcohol withdrawal and received inpatient treatment for alcohol use disorder as well as linkages to outpatient MAT treatment\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. The summary indicates the patient was admitted for ethanol withdrawal and received treatment for alcohol withdrawal symptoms. It also mentions the patient was seen by addiction medicine and social work teams for substance use disorder and discharge planning. However, it does not explicitly mention \\'meth\\' or \\'linkages to outpatient MAT treatment\\'. The summary does mention continuing PO naltrexone 50mg daily and follow up with addiction medicine, which implies some form of treatment for substance use disorder. Despite this, \\'MAT treatment\\' is not explicitly mentioned. The presence of \\'polysubstance use disorder\\' is noted, and \\'alcohol\\' is specified, but \\'meth\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the context of current use or treatment. The hospital course summary does indicate treatment for alcohol use disorder and planning for post discharge care related to addiction medicine.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 11, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient had orthostatic hypotension and was fluid resuscitated \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions orthostatic hypotension in the \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' section, stating \\'She also had orthostatic hypotension, nausea, and pain managed with medication.\\' However, while orthostatic hypotension is mentioned, there is no explicit mention of fluid resuscitation being performed to address this issue. The summary discusses various other interventions and treatments (pain medications, nausea medications, etc.) but does not specifically state that the patient received fluid resuscitation. Since both components of the fact (orthostatic hypotension AND fluid resuscitation) must be present, and only one is mentioned, this fact cannot be considered fully present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient \\'also had orthostatic hypotension, nausea, and pain managed with medication.\\' However, it does not explicitly state that the patient was fluid resuscitated for orthostatic hypotension. The management of orthostatic hypotension is not detailed in the provided summary. Therefore, while orthostatic hypotension is mentioned, the specific treatment of fluid resuscitation for it is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly states under \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' that the patient \\'had orthostatic hypotension, nausea, and pain managed with medication.\\' This confirms the presence of orthostatic hypotension. 2. However, the summary does not mention any fluid resuscitation (e.g., IV fluids, bolus administration, or specific hydration interventions) in any section. While orthostatic hypotension is documented, the therapeutic response to it (fluid resuscitation) is absent from the text. 3. The absence of explicit references to fluid management for hypotension meets the criteria for fact_mentioned: 0, as only one component of the fact (orthostatic hypotension) is present, but the second component fluid resuscitation is not stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 12, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was started on empiric antibiotics but was found to have a normal WBC with normal lactate and abx were discontinued, he was not discharged on antibiotics\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the hospital course summary to look for mentions of empiric antibiotics, WBC counts, lactate levels, and antibiotic discontinuation. Here\\'s what I found: 1. While the summary mentions \\'infectious workup\\' was performed, it does not explicitly state that empiric antibiotics were started. 2. Although WBC count is mentioned as \\'stable,\\' there is no specific mention that it was normal, nor is there any mention of lactate levels. 3. There is no mention of antibiotics being discontinued or the patient\\'s antibiotic status at discharge. While some elements of the target fact are partially addressed (WBC is mentioned as stable), the complete sequence of events described in the target fact (starting empiric antibiotics, finding normal WBC and lactate, discontinuing antibiotics, and confirming no antibiotics at discharge) is not explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention that the patient was started on empiric antibiotics, had normal WBC with normal lactate, and that antibiotics were discontinued. It mentions that the patient was admitted for infectious workup but does not provide details on the administration or discontinuation of antibiotics. The summary focuses on the patient\\'s treatment for hypotension, nutritional support through TPN, and management of pseudomyxoma peritonei with complications. Therefore, the specific fact regarding the use and discontinuation of antibiotics is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states the patient was admitted for infectious workup and mentions a \\'stable WBC count\\' in Problem #1. However, there is no explicit mention of: 1) initiation of empiric antibiotics, 2) lactate levels being normal, 3) antibiotic discontinuation, or 4) discharge without antibiotics. While \\'stable WBC\\' could imply normal WBC, the absence of any reference to antibiotic administration/cessation (despite detailed medication plans in discharge instructions) and lack of lactate documentation means the full fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 12, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was discharged on TPN with instructions to follow up in 4 weeks  \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary step by step looking for explicit mention of discharge on TPN with 4 week follow up instructions: 1. The summary clearly mentions discharge on TPN multiple times: \\'Planned discharge with cyclic TPN meeting 100% nutritional needs\\' \\'Discharge Plan and Goals: Discharge on cyclic TPN\\' 2. However, while follow up care is generally mentioned (\\'with a follow up plan that includes monitoring for complications and nutritional status\\'), there is no specific mention of a 4 week follow up timeframe. 3. Since the fact requires both components (TPN at discharge AND 4 week follow up), and only one component is explicitly mentioned, this cannot be marked as fully present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient was discharged on TPN and had plans for follow up, including monitoring for complications and nutritional status. However, it does not explicitly state that the patient was instructed to follow up in 4 weeks. The summary mentions \\'a follow up plan\\' but does not specify the timing.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient was discharged with TPN in multiple sections: \\'discharge home with TPN\\' (Brief Description) and \\'Planned discharge with cyclic TPN\\' (Problem #2). 2. The \\'follow up in 4 weeks\\' component is not explicitly mentioned anywhere in the text. While follow up monitoring is referenced in the \\'Additional Requirements\\' section (\\'follow up plan that includes monitoring\\'), no specific timeframe of 4 weeks is provided. 3. Since both components of the fact (TPN at discharge AND 4 week follow up) must be present for a \\'1\\' rating, and the 4 week timeframe is absent, the fact as a whole is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details a patient with inflammatory breast cancer who underwent bilateral complete mastectomies and right axillary lymph node dissection. The summary indicates that post operatively, the patient experienced some complications including pain, blistering on her coccyx, hypertension, and tachycardia, but was eventually transitioned to an oral pain regimen and was being weaned off IV pain medications. The summary does not explicitly state that the patient had an \\'unremarkable post operative course.\\' Instead, it mentions several post operative complications. Therefore, the specific fact that the patient had an \\'unremarkable post operative course\\' is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient was admitted for bilateral mastectomy (mentioned in both the One Liner and Problem #1). However, the post operative course is described as having complications (blistering, hypertension, tachycardia, blurry vision, panic attack), which contradicts \\'unremarkable.\\' While discharge home is implied through discharge planning, the key element of an \\'unremarkable post operative course\\' is not met. The presence of documented complications means the fact as phrased (requiring an unremarkable course) is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary carefully, there is no explicit statement about whether the patient\\'s chronic medical conditions, including DM2 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus), were or were not worsened perioperatively. While DM2 is mentioned in the \\'Relevant Medical History\\' section, there is no discussion about its status or management during the perioperative period. The summary details other complications and issues (pain, hypertension, blistering, anxiety) but makes no mention of diabetes control or any changes in diabetes management. Without an explicit statement about the stability or worsening of chronic conditions, particularly DM2, during the perioperative period, we cannot confirm this fact is present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient has a history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) under \\'Relevant Medical History\\'. However, it does not explicitly state whether her chronic medical conditions, including DM2, were worsened perioperatively. The summary discusses various post operative complications such as hypertension, tachycardia, blistering on the coccyx, and a panic attack, but it does not directly address the status of her DM2 during the perioperative period. Therefore, the specific fact that \\'it does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly lists Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) under \\'Relevant Medical History\\' but does not mention any perioperative complications or exacerbations related to DM2. The documented post operative complications (blistering, hypertension, tachycardia) and management focus on surgical recovery, pain, hypertension, and mental health. There is no reference to glycemic control, insulin adjustments, hyperglycemic episodes, or other DM2 related issues in the problem summaries, discharge plans, or complications sections. While DM2 is acknowledged as a chronic condition, its status during the perioperative period is neither described as worsened nor addressed in clinical decision making.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 14, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Dexamethasone taper was started\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The hospital course summary mentions dexamethasone administration in several ways, but does not explicitly mention a dexamethasone taper. Specifically, under Problem #1: Acute Lower Extremity Weakness, it states \\'Treatment with dexamethasone 20 mg IV x1 then 4 mg q6h IV.\\' This indicates that dexamethasone was given, but describes a fixed dosing schedule rather than a tapering regimen. While steroid treatment is mentioned multiple times and the patient improved with steroids, there is no explicit mention of a plan to taper the dexamethasone dose. A taper might have been planned or implemented, but it is not specifically documented in this summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient was treated with dexamethasone for neurofibromatosis type 1. Specifically, under \\'Problem #1: Acute Lower Extremity Weakness,\\' it is stated that \\'Treatment with dexamethasone 20 mg IV x1 then 4 mg q6h IV, and bevacizumab.\\' However, there is no explicit mention of a \\'dexamethasone taper\\' being started. The summary does not provide information on whether the dexamethasone dose was adjusted or tapered after the initial treatment.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states the patient was treated with dexamethasone 20 mg IV x1 followed by 4 mg q6h IV. While this describes a dose reduction from an initial bolus to a lower maintenance dose, the term \\'taper\\' (which implies a structured, stepwise dose reduction over time) is not explicitly used. The summary does not mention further planned dose reductions or use clinical terminology synonymous with a formal taper protocol. The described dosing could represent the initiation of a taper, but this is an inference rather than an explicit statement.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of viral gastroenteritis as the principal diagnosis at discharge. While the patient presented with nausea and vomiting, which are symptoms that can be associated with viral gastroenteritis, the summary indicates these symptoms were considered in the context of causing AKI through hypovolemia. The Problem Based Summary lists \\'Nausea and Vomiting\\' as Problem #2, but does not attribute it to a viral cause. The etiology of the nausea and vomiting is not explicitly stated. The summary focuses primarily on the patient\\'s AKI and its management, along with their underlying conditions including ESKD, HFrEF, and diabetes. Without an explicit statement identifying viral gastroenteritis as the principal discharge diagnosis, I cannot confirm this fact is present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' as the principal diagnosis at discharge. The summary indicates the patient was admitted for acute kidney injury (AKI) likely precipitated by nausea and vomiting. Although nausea and vomiting are mentioned, there is no clear indication that they were caused by viral gastroenteritis. The summary discusses various problems including AKI, nausea and vomiting, and chronic heart failure, but viral gastroenteritis is not listed among them. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states that the patient was admitted for AKI in the setting of nausea and vomiting, which resolved during hospitalization. While the nausea/vomiting is documented as the precipitant for AKI, the summary does not mention \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' (or equivalent terms like \\'infectious gastroenteritis\\' or \\'viral GI illness\\') as the underlying cause. The evaluation for infection noted negative blood cultures and absence of SIRS criteria, but no specific viral testing or gastroenteritis diagnosis is documented. The discharge summary attributes the AKI to hypovolemia from nausea/vomiting without specifying their etiology. Since the principal diagnosis at discharge would typically reflect the root cause of the admission triggering symptoms, and no such explicit diagnosis is provided, the fact is not mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 15, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily stopped when the patient initially came to the hospital.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention that immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily stopped upon admission. While these medications are mentioned in the \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section regarding potential adjustments (\\'Adjustments to medications such as tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone as per the renal transplant team\\'s recommendations\\'), and the summary does mention \\'holding nephrotoxic agents\\' under Problem #1 (AKI), it does not specifically state that these immunosuppressant medications were among those held. The holding of other medications like Entresto and metoprolol succinate is explicitly mentioned, demonstrating that the summary does note when medications are stopped, but it does not indicate the same for the immunosuppressants.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly state that immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily stopped when the patient initially came to the hospital. While the summary mentions \\'Adjustments to medications such as tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone as per the renal transplant team\\'s recommendations\\' under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' and \\'Resume regular medications as tolerated\\' under the discharge plan for Problem #1: Acute Kidney Injury, it does not directly state that these medications were stopped upon admission. However, it is mentioned that \\'Holding nephrotoxic agents and contrast\\' was part of the therapeutic procedure for AKI, which could imply that potentially nephrotoxic or sensitive medications like immunosuppressants might have been managed cautiously, but it\\'s not a direct statement about stopping immunosuppressants.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'adjustments to medications such as tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone\\' under Medication Management and states \\'resume regular medications as tolerated\\' in the AKI discharge plan. However, there is no explicit documentation that these immunosuppressants were temporarily stopped at initial presentation. While nephrotoxic agents were held (Problem #1), the specific immunosuppressants are not directly linked to this action. The summary implies potential dose adjustments but does not clearly state a temporary discontinuation at admission. A busy physician would likely require explicit confirmation of the initial hold to mark this as present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 16, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Currently on high dose dexamethasone and Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After analyzing the hospital course summary, I can confirm that while dexamethasone use is mentioned (\\'continued on IV dexamethasone 4mg BID for vasogenic edema\\'), there is no mention of Bactrim or Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis. The summary details the patient\\'s steroid use, specifically noting \\'IV dexamethasone 4mg BID\\' under Problem #1, but does not indicate whether PJP prophylaxis was initiated despite the high dose steroid use. Even though this might be standard practice for patients on high dose steroids, we cannot assume it was implemented without explicit documentation in the summary. The fact requires both components (high dose dexamethasone AND Bactrim for PJP prophylaxis) to be considered fully present, and while the first component is documented, the second is not.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient is on IV dexamethasone 4mg BID for vasogenic edema and symptom control. However, it does not explicitly mention \\'high dose dexamethasone.\\' The dose mentioned is 4mg BID, which may or may not be considered high dose depending on the context, but it\\'s specific. Additionally, the summary does not mention Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis. Therefore, the fact \\'Currently on high dose dexamethasone and Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\' is not explicitly mentioned in its entirety.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Dexamethasone: The summary explicitly states the patient is on IV dexamethasone 4mg BID for vasogenic edema. While \\'high dose\\' isn\\'t explicitly quantified, 4mg BID (8mg/day) is a standard high dose for cerebral edema in this context. 2. Bactrim/PJP prophylaxis: No mention of Bactrim, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, or Pneumocystis prophylaxis appears in any section of the summary. While steroid use would typically warrant PJP prophylaxis, the text contains no evidence this was implemented. Since both components of the fact must be present for a \\'1\\' rating and Bactrim prophylaxis is absent, the fact is not fully mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 17, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Delirium tremens requiring intravenous benzodiazepines and phenobarbital for symptom control\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary describes severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms (hallucinations, tremors) treated with IV Ativan (a benzodiazepine) and 520 mg IV phenobarbital. While this aligns with delirium tremens management, the term \\'delirium tremens\\' itself is never explicitly stated. The documentation refers to \\'acute ethanol withdrawal with perceptual disturbances\\' and \\'severe withdrawal symptoms\\' but does not use the specific diagnosis of delirium tremens or an unambiguous clinical synonym. The treatment matches standard care for DTs, but the absence of explicit terminology or a direct link between the diagnosis and the medications (e.g., \\'DTs requiring...\\') means the fact is not fully articulated as per the criteria.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 17, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, coupled with ketosis secondary to probable starvation and alcohol use\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step for the specific fact: 1. Hypokalemia: Explicitly mentioned in Problem #3 with K+ level of 2.6 2. Hypomagnesemia: Not explicitly mentioned in the text 3. Ketosis: Mentioned in Problem #1 under \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\' 4. Secondary to starvation and alcohol use: While alcohol use/abuse is clearly documented throughout, starvation is not explicitly mentioned as a cause of the ketosis While some components are present (hypokalemia and ketosis with alcohol use), the complete combination of all elements (particularly hypomagnesemia and explicit connection to starvation) is not fully present in the text. The fact requires all these elements to be considered fully mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions hypokalemia with a potassium level of 2.6 under Problem #3: Hypokalemia. It also mentions ketosis under Problem #1: Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome with Perceptual Disturbance, where labs showed \\'anion gap without metabolic acidosis, and ketosis.\\' Although hypomagnesemia is not directly mentioned in the summary, there is a mention of \\'follow up labs in 1 week for potassium and magnesium levels after discharge\\' under Outstanding Issues/Follow Up, indicating that magnesium levels were a concern. The summary also notes the patient\\'s history of alcohol abuse and probable starvation is implied as a context for ketosis. Thus, hypokalemia and ketosis secondary to probable starvation and alcohol use are mentioned. However, hypomagnesemia itself is not explicitly stated as present, only that magnesium levels need follow up.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Hypokalemia is explicitly mentioned in Problem #3 with K+ 2.6. 2. Hypomagnesemia is not explicitly stated in the summary while follow up for magnesium levels is planned, no low magnesium level is reported. 3. Ketosis is mentioned in Problem #1\\'s labs. 4. The summary does not explicitly link ketosis to starvation (though alcohol use is documented in the history). While the combination of hypokalemia and ketosis in an alcoholic patient suggests possible starvation, the explicit phrase \\'secondary to probable starvation and alcohol use\\' is not stated. The required combination of all three elements (hypokalemia + hypomagnesemia + ketosis etiology) is not fully met as hypomagnesemia isn\\'t confirmed and starvation isn\\'t explicitly cited.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After analyzing the hospital course summary, the specific fact of \\'persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\' is not explicitly mentioned. Here\\'s the step by step analysis: 1. The summary does mention fever and infectious workup: Patient was admitted for fever Received broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) Blood cultures and other infectious workup were negative 2. Regarding pulmonary findings: Only mention is \\'CXR: Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis\\' No specific mention of suspected pulmonary infection 3. Regarding fever persistence: The summary actually states \\'His fever resolved\\' There\\'s no indication of fever persisting 4. The etiology of fever is attributed to possible tumor fever rather than pulmonary infection: \\'Possible tumor fever due to lymphoma, as infectious causes were ruled out\\' While there was fever and negative infectious workup, the specific combination of persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection is not present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details a patient admitted for fever, with a complex history of de novo transformed high grade B cell lymphoma. The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) for fever and possible infection. The summary notes that blood cultures and other infectious workup results were negative, and the fever resolved. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section mentions that infectious causes were ruled out, and \\'Fever Etiology\\' was considered possibly due to tumor fever. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' under \\'Problem #1: Fever of Unknown Origin\\' lists negative blood cultures and a CXR showing low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis, which could be interpreted as suggesting a pulmonary issue. However, there\\'s no explicit mention of \\'suspected pulmonary infection.\\' The closest relevant information is the CXR result and the initial treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics for possible infection, but the summary does not directly state that there was a suspicion of pulmonary infection despite negative workups.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states the patient was admitted for fever and received broad spectrum antibiotics for possible infection. Blood cultures and other infectious workups were negative, and the fever resolved. While pulmonary involvement is mentioned (CXR showing bibasilar atelectasis), there is no explicit mention of a suspected pulmonary infection as part of the fever etiology. The text specifically attributes the fever to possible tumor fever after ruling out infectious causes. Though infection was initially considered, the absence of direct reference to pulmonary infection as a suspected source (despite imaging findings) and the resolution of fever with antibiotics/negative workups means the exact phrasing of \\'persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\' is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 19, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis).\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I cannot find explicit mention of hydronephrosis being complicated by UTIs with specifically ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis together. While the summary does mention both hydronephrosis (in the medical history) and UTIs (including a current infection with E. faecalis), it does not explicitly state that the hydronephrosis is complicated by these specific organisms. The only organism mentioned in the current admission is E. faecalis, and there is no mention of ESBL E. coli or Klebsiella. While the patient has a history of recurrent UTIs and bilateral hydronephrosis, the specific causal relationship and the complete set of organisms are not explicitly stated in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient has bilateral hydronephrosis and recurrent UTIs. The urine culture grew E. Faecalis, indicating a urinary tract infection. However, the summary does not explicitly state that the hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections caused by ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis. It does mention E. Faecalis, which is one of the pathogens listed, but it does not mention ESBL E. coli or Klebsiella in the context of complicating hydronephrosis. Therefore, the specific fact that hydronephrosis is complicated by UTIs caused by all three mentioned pathogens (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis) is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly lists \\'bilateral hydronephrosis\\' in the patient\\'s medical history (One Liner and Relevant Medical History sections). 2. The summary documents recurrent UTIs and specifically identifies E. Faecalis in urine culture (Problem #1: UTI section). 3. However, there is no mention of ESBL E. coli or Klebsiella in any part of the document. While Enterococcus faecalis is confirmed, the other two specified organisms (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella) are absent from all urine culture reports and problem descriptions. 4. The phrase \\'complicated by\\' implies a direct association between hydronephrosis and these specific pathogens. While hydronephrosis and UTIs are both documented, the explicit linkage to all three organisms (particularly ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella) is missing. 5. Clinical synonyms or abbreviations for these organisms (e.g., \\'MDRO\\' or \\'gram negative rods\\') are also absent. The documentation meets only 1/3 components of the specified fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 19, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Chronic opioid use and opioid-related constipation. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'Chronic Opioid Use\\' as Problem #5, including details about prescriptions and pain management. However, while \\'Chronic Constipation\\' is listed as Problem #2 and managed with a bowel regimen, there is no explicit statement linking the constipation to opioid use. The summary does not use terms like \\'opioid related constipation,\\' nor does it describe a causal relationship between the two. Both components of the fact (chronic opioid use and constipation) are present but are documented as separate issues without explicit association.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 20, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** HHT with new PE/DVT s/p IVC filter placement as well as changed to fondaparinux\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1. HHT : Explicitly mentioned in the one liner and Problem #3. 2. New PE/DVT : Documented in admission reason (extension of RLE DVT) and imaging findings (multifocal PEs with pulmonary infarcts). 3. IVC filter placement : Clearly stated in therapeutic procedures and surgical history. 4. Changed to fondaparinux : The summary states the patient was \\'started on fondaparinux\\' upon transfer but does NOT describe a transition from another anticoagulant to fondaparinux. The subsequent transition was from fondaparinux to apixaban. While fondaparinux use is documented, the specific action of \\'changing to\\' fondaparinux (implying a switch from another agent) is not explicitly stated. The critical distinction is between initiating therapy (\\'started on\\') versus changing therapy (\\'changed to\\'), which are not clinical synonyms in this context.\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 20, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I did not find any explicit mention of ordering twice weekly CBCs after discharge. While the summary does mention follow up CBC monitoring in two places: 1) Under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' it mentions \\'plan for CBC with differential\\' as part of thrombocytopenia workup, and 2) Under \\'Problem #2: Thrombocytopenia\\' it lists \\'Follow up CBC with differential\\' in the discharge plan, neither of these specifies a twice weekly frequency. The summary clearly indicates that CBC monitoring is planned, but the specific timing/frequency of twice weekly is not documented anywhere in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if the fact \\'Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary includes a \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' section under \\'Problem #2: Thrombocytopenia\\', which states \\'Follow up CBC with differential.\\' While this indicates a plan for follow up CBC, it does not specify the frequency as \\'twice weekly\\'. The summary does not explicitly mention the frequency of CBCs after discharge.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions under \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' for Problem #2 (Thrombocytopenia) a \\'Follow up CBC with differential\\' but does not specify the frequency. While CBC monitoring is clearly part of the follow up plan, the explicit instruction for \\'twice weekly\\' frequency is absent from all sections including discharge planning, therapeutic procedures, and follow up instructions. The summary discusses ongoing thrombocytopenia management and prednisone use but does not quantify CBC frequency beyond stating it will be part of follow up.\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find explicit mention of falls being of unknown etiology despite extensive workup. While the summary does mention \\'recurrent falls\\' multiple times and includes some workup details (such as ECG monitoring and noting \\'no significant ECG changes or volume overload/clinical or lab findings to suggest low output\\'), it does not specifically state that the etiology remained unknown or that the workup was extensive yet inconclusive. In fact, the summary suggests some potential contributing factors were identified, including the patient\\'s cardiac conditions (runs of nonsustained SVT), dementia, and hospital delirium. The workup described appears focused but not explicitly described as \\'extensive,\\' and nowhere does the summary indicate that the cause of falls remained a mystery despite thorough investigation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'recurrent falls\\' as a key problem and describes evaluations (ECG, tele monitoring, lab findings) that did not identify a clear cause. However, the summary does not explicitly state that the etiology remains \\'unknown\\' or that the workup was \\'extensive.\\' While negative findings imply unresolved etiology, the absence of direct phrasing like \\'unknown etiology\\' or documentation of a comprehensive evaluation (e.g., neurology consult, imaging beyond cardiac) means the fact is not fully articulated as per the required wording. A physician might infer it, but it is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**34. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention that the T6 wedge compression fracture likely happened before the most recent fall. While the summary does mention a T6 compression fracture multiple times (notably in the one liner and Problem #1 section), and describes it as a \\'new interval anterior wedge compression deformity of T6,\\' it does not specify the timing of the fracture in relation to the recent falls. The summary mentions \\'several falls at home\\' but does not establish a temporal relationship between these falls and when the fracture occurred. The term \\'likely subacute\\' is used in the one liner, but this doesn\\'t definitively indicate the fracture predated the most recent fall. Without an explicit statement about the timing of the fracture in relation to the falls, we cannot confirm this specific fact is mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that Mrs. Esther Mallonee was found to have a T6 compression fracture. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' under \\'Problem #1: T6 Wedge Compression Fracture\\' provides detailed information about the diagnosis and management of the T6 wedge compression fracture. However, the summary does not explicitly state that the T6 wedge compression fracture likely happened before the most recent fall. The information provided indicates that the fracture was identified after several falls at home, but it does not clearly state the timing of when the fracture occurred relative to the falls.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states the T6 compression fracture is described as \\'likely subacute\\' in the One Liner and \\'new interval\\' in Problem #1. \\'Subacute\\' implies the fracture occurred days to weeks prior, and \\'new interval\\' suggests it developed between imaging studies. While this indicates the fracture predates the current hospitalization, the summary does not explicitly compare its timing to the \\'most recent fall\\' (among her \\'several falls\\'). The text confirms the fracture exists but does not directly link it to occurring before a specific recent fall. A busy physician would recognize the temporal implication of \\'subacute\\' but would not find explicit confirmation of the fracture predating the most recent fall.\\n\\n\\n\\n**35. Patient 21, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Increased to metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily is explicitly mentioned in Problem #5: HFrEF section under \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' where it states \\'Continue home Lasix and metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily.\\' However, the summary does not specifically state that the dose was increased to this level. It only mentions this as a continuation of home medication. Since the fact we\\'re looking for specifically asks about an increase to metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily, and there is no mention of any dose adjustment or increase, this specific fact is not present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if the fact \\'Increased to metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily\\' is explicitly mentioned. Upon reviewing the summary, it is noted that under Problem #5: HFrEF, the \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' section states \\'Continue home Lasix and metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily.\\' This indicates that the patient was already on metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily as a home medication, which was continued during the hospital stay. However, there is no explicit mention of the dose being \\'increased\\' to this level during the hospitalization. The summary does not provide information on any changes made to the medication dosage during the hospital stay. Therefore, the fact \\'Increased to metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily\\' is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary includes a section for each active problem (Problem #5: HFrEF). 2. Under \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' for HFrEF, it states: \\'Continue home Lasix and metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily.\\' 3. The key word is \\'continue\\' this indicates the 50 mg dose was part of her home regimen rather than a new increase during hospitalization. 4. No other sections mention dose adjustments to metoprolol. The text does not contain any references to increasing, titrating, or adjusting the metoprolol dose from a previous value. 5. While the 50 mg dose is explicitly stated, the act of increasing to this dose is not documented in any part of the provided summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**36. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find any explicit mention of continuing or re evaluating Augmentin therapy, nor any reference to a 14 day completion period for Augmentin. The only antibiotic therapy mentioned in the summary is Zosyn, which was started empirically for suspected cholangitis and sepsis. The summary discusses blood cultures growing E. coli and mentions continuing antibiotic therapy in general terms under Problem #3 (\\'Continue antibiotic therapy as needed\\'), but makes no specific reference to Augmentin or its re evaluation. While antibiotic management is clearly part of the patient\\'s care plan, this specific detail about Augmentin therapy and its 14 day course is not explicitly stated in the provided text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s treatment with Zosyn for suspected cholangitis and sepsis, with blood cultures growing E. coli. However, it does not explicitly mention \\'Augmentin therapy.\\' The summary lists \\'Zosyn\\' as the antibiotic used, which is a different antibiotic from \\'Augmentin.\\' There is no mention of \\'Augmentin\\' or a plan to continue or re evaluate \\'Augmentin therapy\\' prior to a 14 day completion. Therefore, the specific fact about continuing and re evaluating Augmentin therapy is not present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions continuing Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) for suspected cholangitis and sepsis, with no reference to Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate). The \\'Outstanding/Pending Issues\\' under Problem #3 state \\'Complete antibiotic course,\\' but there is no indication of a plan to re evaluate Augmentin therapy specifically before completing a 14 day course. Since Augmentin is not mentioned at all in the summary, and Zosyn is the documented antibiotic, the fact is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**37. Patient 22, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** patient should follow up with Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/ Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Poultsides, George, MD in in 2 weeks\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, including the One Liner, Brief Description, Outstanding Issues/Follow Up, and Problem Based Summary sections, I do not find any explicit mention of follow up appointments with either an Advanced Practice Provider in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. While the summary does mention some follow up appointments (specifically a Radiation Oncology appointment on 01/02/2024 and mentions of outpatient SLP follow up), it does not include the specific follow up schedule with an APP at 1 week and Dr. Poultsides at 2 weeks. The only physician follow up mentioned is with Dr. Butler for second opinion and planned surveillance, but without specific timing.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was thoroughly reviewed to determine if the specific follow up instructions for the patient were mentioned. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists several follow up appointments and management plans, including a scheduled outpatient appointment with Radiation Oncology. However, there is no explicit mention of a follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant) in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides, George, MD in 2 weeks. The summary details various follow up plans, but none match the specific fact in question.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary\\'s \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section and discharge plans mention follow ups with Radiation Oncology (01/02/2024), Speech Pathology (SLP), and Dr. Butler. However, there is no explicit reference to follow up with an Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant) in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides, George, MD in 2 weeks. The name \\'Poultsides, George, MD\\' does not appear in the text, and no APP follow up timeframe is specified. While other follow ups are documented, the specific providers and timelines in the fact are absent.\\n\\n\\n\\n**38. Patient 23, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary step by step: 1. First checked the one liner and brief description for mentions of both CLL and mitral valve issues 2. Found CLL mentioned multiple times, including \\'Rai Stage II CLL\\' in history 3. Found mitral valve references including \\'s/p AVR/MVR\\' (mitral valve replacement) in history 4. Specifically looked for language indicating progression of CLL and mitral valve problems 5. Found evidence of progressing CLL (WBC 477.7K, requiring treatment) 6. Found reference to mitral valvulopathy in follow up section (\\'assess mitral valve gradient\\') 7. Most importantly, the text does not explicitly state that findings are \\'in setting of progressing CLL and mitral valvulopathy\\' as a combined clinical context 8. While both conditions are present and discussed, their relationship as a combined setting is not explicitly stated\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. CLL Progression Analysis : The summary mentions \\'Rai Stage II CLL\\' and \\'leukocytosis to 477K\\' with \\'leukocytosis downtrending,\\' but does not explicitly state that CLL is \\'progressing.\\' While elevated WBC suggests disease activity, the term \\'progressing\\' or equivalent (e.g., \\'worsening CLL\\') is absent. 2. Mitral Valvulopathy Analysis : The patient has a history of \\'s/p AVR/MVR\\' (mitral valve replacement) and requires a follow up TTE to assess \\'mitral valve gradient.\\' However, \\'mitral valvulopathy\\' (a term like \\'mitral valve disease\\' or \\'dysfunction\\') is not explicitly stated. MVR implies prior valvulopathy, but the summary does not confirm active or ongoing valvulopathy in the current admission context. 3. Combined Context : Neither \\'progressing CLL\\' nor \\'mitral valvulopathy\\' (or a clear synonym) is explicitly mentioned. While related terms (e.g., MVR, elevated WBC) are present, they do not meet the threshold for explicit mention of the specific fact as phrased.\\n\\n\\n\\n**39. Patient 23, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I do not find any explicit mention of plans for cardiology to coordinate follow up with the Heart Failure team regarding transcatheter MVR or a new clinical trial drug in 4/2023. While the summary does mention cardiology follow up under Problem #4 (Heart Failure), it is only mentioned in general terms (\\'Cardiology follow up\\' under \\'Outstanding/Pending Issues\\'). The summary does note the patient\\'s history of MVR and current heart failure status, but there is no specific mention of transcatheter MVR discussions, clinical trials, or any specific timing in April 2023. The follow up plans listed are more general in nature, focusing on monitoring cardiac function, daily weights, and basic cardiology follow up.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention that Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR or a new clinical trial drug in April 2023. While there is a mention of \\'Cardiology follow up\\' under Problem #4: Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction, it does not specify the details regarding transcatheter MVR or a new clinical trial drug. Therefore, the specific fact is not explicitly mentioned in the provided summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'Cardiology follow up\\' under Problem #4 (Heart Failure) but does not explicitly state that cardiology will coordinate with the Heart Failure team regarding transcatheter MVR or a new clinical trial drug in April 2023. While follow up TTE to assess mitral valve gradient is listed, there is no reference to transcatheter intervention, clinical trial drugs, or a specific April 2023 timeline. The absence of these specific elements means the fact as stated is not explicitly documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**40. Patient 24, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the hospital course summary step by step looking for mentions of discharge diet and pain medications: 1. The summary mentions diet progression to full liquids during hospitalization (\\'later advanced to a full liquid diet\\') 2. Under Problem #1\\'s Discharge Plan, it states \\'Advance diet as tolerated\\' 3. However, while the full liquid diet is mentioned during the hospital stay, the summary does not explicitly state that the patient was discharged on a full liquid diet 4. There is no mention anywhere in the summary about discharge pain medications or pain management While some elements are present (full liquid diet during hospitalization), the specific combination of being discharged on both a full liquid diet AND oral pain medications is not explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions the patient was \\'advanced to a full liquid diet\\' during admission and tolerated oral intake, fulfilling the first part of the fact. However, there is no mention of \\'oral pain medications\\' being prescribed or administered at discharge. While pain management is implied (given the admission for abdominal pain), the summary does not state this component. Since the fact requires both elements, and one is missing, the conclusion is that the full fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**41. Patient 25, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary thoroughly, the specific fact about the upper GI series and GI consultation is not explicitly mentioned. While the summary does mention duodenitis, gastric distention, and treatment with IV famotidine, it does not include any information about: 1) An upper GI series being performed, 2) Results showing no gastric outlet obstruction, 3) Consultation with general GI and advanced GI, or 4) Recommendations for ERCP evaluation. The only related information is that the patient received IV famotidine and had NGT placement for decompression. The summary mentions duodenitis but doesn\\'t describe how it was diagnosed or the specific treatment recommendations that were made. The switch to PPI and the 8 week empiric PPI treatment plan are also not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, it is clear that there is no mention of an \\'Upper GI series\\', nor is there any mention of discussions with \\'general GI and advanced GI\\' or recommendations for \\'empiric PPI for 8 weeks\\' and \\'outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP\\'. The summary does mention the use of \\'IV famotidine\\' and the presence of \\'duodenitis and gastric distention\\', which were treated with IV famotidine and NGT decompression. However, the specific details about the Upper GI series and the GI consultations are not present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary mentions treatment with IV famotidine and improvement of duodenitis/gastric distention, but does not explicitly state that an Upper GI series was performed or its results (no obstruction). 2. While famotidine use is documented, there is no mention of switching to PPI BID or any PPI regimen. 3. The summary states the case was discussed with GI teams but does not specify that EGD/ERCP was deferred or that empiric PPI for 8 weeks + outpatient ERCP evaluation was recommended. 4. Key elements of the fact (Upper GI results, PPI transition, GI consult recommendations) are absent in both the hospital course narrative and problem based summaries.\\n\\n\\n\\n**42. Patient 25, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) on admission or its treatment with fluids. The summary details several medical issues including pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ascites, portal vein thrombosis, and neutropenia, but does not mention any kidney problems. The problems list, therapeutic interventions, and complications discussed do not include any reference to kidney dysfunction or fluid resuscitation for AKI. While IV fluids may have been administered during the hospitalization, there is no specific mention of this being done to treat AKI. The outstanding issues and follow up plans also do not mention any kidney related concerns or monitoring.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** To determine if the fact \\'AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary, I analyzed the provided text. The summary includes sections such as \\'One Liner\\', \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\', \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\', \\'Problem Based Summary\\', \\'Relevant Medical History\\', and \\'Relevant Surgical History\\'. I searched for keywords related to \\'AKI\\' (Acute Kidney Injury), \\'admission\\', \\'fluids\\', and \\'resolved\\'. Upon reviewing the text, there was no mention of \\'AKI\\', \\'acute kidney injury\\', or any equivalent term indicating kidney injury or failure on admission. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' and other sections detailed the patient\\'s hospital course, including treatments and conditions, but none referenced AKI or its treatment with fluids. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed in detail. The \\'AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved\\' fact was not found in any section. The summary documents ascites, neutropenia, portal vein thrombosis, and duodenitis, with treatments including paracentesis, filgrastim, Lovenox, and famotidine. No mention of acute kidney injury (AKI), fluid resuscitation for AKI, or resolution of AKI appears in the admission details, problem lists, interventions, or follow up plans. While fluid administration might be inferred in general care, the text does not explicitly link fluids to AKI management or resolution.\\n\\n\\n\\n**43. Patient 26, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Metoprolol dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily for improved rate control; Apixaban dosage increased to 5 mg twice daily for anticoagulation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I find that only part of the fact is explicitly mentioned. While metoprolol dosage of 75 mg BID is explicitly stated in the Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section (\\'metoprolol succinate 75 mg BID\\'), there is no mention of increasing this dose from a previous level. Additionally, while the patient is noted to be on \\'reduced dose apixaban\\' in the one liner, there is no mention anywhere in the summary of increasing the apixaban dose to 5 mg twice daily. The summary discusses the patient\\'s atrial fibrillation/flutter management but does not document these specific medication dose changes. Since both medication dose increases are not explicitly mentioned, this fact cannot be considered present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if the fact \\'Metoprolol dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily for improved rate control; Apixaban dosage increased to 5 mg twice daily for anticoagulation\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary indicates that the patient was on \\'metoprolol succinate 75 mg BID\\' for rate control as part of the \\'Atrial Flutter Management\\' plan under \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\'. However, it does not explicitly state that the metoprolol dosage was increased to this level during the hospital stay. It also mentions that the patient was on \\'reduced dose apixaban\\' prior to admission, but does not specify that the apixaban dosage was increased to 5 mg twice daily during the hospital stay. The summary does not directly state the increase in apixaban dosage. Therefore, the fact is partially mentioned in terms of metoprolol dosage but not explicitly stated as being increased. The apixaban dosage increase is not mentioned at all.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Checked \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section: Metoprolol succinate 75 mg BID is explicitly listed under Atrial Flutter Management. 2. Reviewed Problem #2 (Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter) details: Confirmed metoprolol dosage but found no mention of apixaban dosage changes. 3. Scanned entire document for anticoagulation changes: Original history mentions \\'reduced dose apixaban\\' but discharge plan doesn\\'t specify dosage increases. 4. Conclusion: While metoprolol increase is documented, the apixaban dosage increase to 5 mg BID is not explicitly stated anywhere in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**44. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The hospital course summary does contain information about both the patient\\'s emesis and SMA stenosis, but does not explicitly connect them as a potential cause and effect relationship. Specifically: 1. The summary mentions \\'severe nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain\\' as presenting symptoms 2. The CT Angiography finding is documented under Problem #1 as \\'Moderate narrowing of the proximal superior mesenteric artery, no acute mesenteric ischemia\\' 3. However, the summary attributes the patient\\'s symptoms primarily to gastroparesis (mentioned multiple times) and does not make an explicit connection between the SMA stenosis and the patient\\'s emesis 4. In fact, the CT finding specifically notes \\'no acute mesenteric ischemia,\\' and chronic mesenteric ischemia is not discussed as a potential cause of symptoms\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission and management. The key fact to determine is whether the patient\\'s emesis (vomiting) may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia due to superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis as revealed by CT angiography. The summary under \\'Problem #1: Epigastric Pain, Nausea, and Vomiting\\' mentions that CT Abdomen Pelvis Angiography showed \\'moderate narrowing of the proximal superior mesenteric artery.\\' However, it also states \\'no acute mesenteric ischemia.\\' The summary does not explicitly link the patient\\'s emesis to chronic mesenteric ischemia or SMA stenosis. It focuses on symptomatic therapies for gastroparesis and dyspepsia, suggesting that the management was directed more towards these conditions rather than chronic mesenteric ischemia. Therefore, while the presence of SMA stenosis is mentioned, its relation to the patient\\'s emesis is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'moderate narrowing of the proximal superior mesenteric artery\\' (SMA stenosis) on CT angiography under Problem #1. However, it states \\'no acute mesenteric ischemia\\' and does not explicitly link the SMA stenosis to chronic mesenteric ischemia as a potential cause of emesis. The summary attributes the vomiting to gastroparesis/dyspepsia and focuses on managing these conditions, without discussing chronic mesenteric ischemia as a possible etiology. While SMA stenosis is documented, the causal connection to emesis via chronic mesenteric ischemia is not explicitly stated or paraphrased.\\n\\n\\n\\n**45. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details a patient admitted for neutropenic fever, with blood cultures growing Coag Negative Staph bacteremia. The patient was treated with antibiotics and the PICC line was removed. The important fact to look for mentions \\'coagulase negative strep bacteremia,\\' but the summary actually reports \\'Coag Negative Staph bacteremia,\\' which refers to coagulase negative Staphylococcus, not Streptococcus. Although these are different bacteria, they are both gram positive cocci and can cause similar issues in the context of a central line infection. The summary explicitly mentions the presence of bacteremia due to Coag Negative Staph, treatment with antibiotics, and removal of the PICC line. Therefore, while there is a discrepancy between \\'Strep\\' and \\'Staph,\\' the clinical context and management (PICC removal and antibiotics) are correctly described for a bacteremia related to a PICC line.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course states the patient was admitted for neutropenic fever, matching the first part of the fact. 2. Blood cultures identified \\'Coag Negative Staph bacteremia\\' (explicitly stated), which is a clinical abbreviation/synonym for coagulase negative staphylococcus. However, the fact specifies \\'coagulase negative strep\\' (streptococcus), which is a different organism genus. 3. The summary explicitly documents PICC line removal and plans for replacement, fulfilling that component. 4. Antibiotic treatment (vancomycin, cefepime, linezolid) is clearly described. Conclusion: While most elements align, the critical discrepancy between \\'Staph\\' (documented) and \\'Strep\\' (queried) makes the bacteremia organism factually incorrect in the context of the specific query. Thus, the exact fact is not fully present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**46. Patient 27, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed the entire hospital course summary, searching for any mention of a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed on 3/6/23 or any other date. The summary includes detailed information about the patient\\'s hospital course, diagnostic tests (including CT maxillofacial, blood cultures, and UA), and multiple medical problems (AML, neutropenic fever, and T2DM). However, there is no mention anywhere in the text of a TTE being performed, nor any reference to cardiac imaging or findings related to masses or vegetations. All diagnostic tests mentioned are clearly listed, and a TTE from 3/6/23 is not among them.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations\\' is explicitly mentioned in the provided hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, it is clear that there is no mention of a Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) performed on 3/6/23 or any equivalent statement regarding the absence of mass or vegetations on that date. The summary includes various details about the patient\\'s hospital course, diagnostic investigations, and treatment plans, but does not reference a TTE on the specified date or any findings related to it.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed in detail. The fact in question is \\'TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations.\\' A thorough review of all sections (One Liner, Brief Description, Outstanding Issues, Problem Based Summaries, and Medical/Surgical History) reveals no mention of a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed on 3/6/23 or any echocardiogram findings. The only imaging mentioned is a CT maxillofacial on 3/5/23. While bacteremia and line removal are documented, there is no reference to cardiac imaging or vegetation/mass evaluation. The date 3/6/23 is not associated with any procedure in the text. Since neither the TTE itself nor its findings are explicitly stated or implied through clinical synonyms, the fact is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**47. Patient 27, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Analyzing the summary for evidence of tonsilitis and antibiotic treatment: 1. The CT maxillofacial showed \\'mild enlarged tonsils L>R, no abscess\\' 2. While antibiotics were given (zosyn, vancomycin, cefepime, linezolid), they were clearly administered for neutropenic fever and subsequent Coag Negative Staph bacteremia, not for tonsilitis 3. There are no mentioned symptoms specifically localizing to the tonsils (no mention of sore throat, difficulty swallowing, etc.) 4. The enlarged tonsils appear to be an incidental finding on imaging rather than a clinical focus of infection requiring treatment 5. The antibiotic choices and changes were guided by blood culture results, not by tonsil findings\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. The summary mentions that the patient was admitted for neutropenic fever and was started on antibiotics (zosyn and vancomycin) empirically. The CT maxillofacial showed mild enlarged tonsils (L>R) but no abscess, indicating some issue with the tonsils. However, the summary does not explicitly mention \\'localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis.\\' It does mention treatment with antibiotics for neutropenic fever and Coag Negative Staph bacteremia. While the presence of mild enlarged tonsils could be interpreted as related to tonsillitis, the summary does not directly state that the patient had symptoms suggestive of tonsillitis or that the antibiotics were specifically for tonsillitis. Therefore, the fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary mentions a CT maxillofacial showing \\'mild enlarged tonsils L>R\\' under both the Brief Description and Problem #1. This satisfies the \\'imaging\\' component. 2. However, there is no documentation of localizing symptoms (e.g., sore throat, dysphagia) specifically suggestive of tonsillitis. 3. While antibiotics (zosyn, vancomycin, cefepime, linezolid) were administered, they are explicitly directed at neutropenic fever and Coag Negative Staph bacteremia treatment, not specifically for tonsillitis. The enlarged tonsils are noted as an incidental imaging finding without clinical correlation to infection. Therefore, only part of the fact (imaging finding) is present, but not the full triad of imaging + symptoms + antibiotic treatment targeting tonsillitis.\\n\\n\\n\\n**48. Patient 28, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step: 1. The summary mentions biliary obstruction multiple times, including in the one liner and Problem #1. 2. The patient has hyperbilirubinemia, explicitly mentioned in Problem #2 with a value of 16.8 mg/dL. 3. PTBD (percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage) is mentioned in the Brief Description and Problem #1. 4. However, while PTBD and drain exchange are mentioned generally, there is no specific mention of a PTBD exchange occurring on 4/21/23. 5. The text indicates this is a recurrent issue (new primary cholangiocarcinoma after previous treatment in 2017), but doesn\\'t explicitly state \\'recurrent malignant biliary obstruction\\'. 6. While many elements of the fact are present (biliary obstruction, hyperbilirubinemia, PTBD), the specific date (4/21/23) and explicit description of the condition as \\'recurrent malignant\\' are not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if it explicitly mentions the fact \\'Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23.\\' The summary indicates the patient was admitted for biliary obstruction and weakness, had a history of cholangiocarcinoma, and underwent PTBD with drain exchange. However, the specific date \\'4/21/23\\' is not mentioned in the summary. Despite this, the key elements of the fact—admission for biliary obstruction, presence of hyperbilirubinemia, and PTBD exchange—are all mentioned. The absence of the specific date is considered a minor detail, as the critical clinical information is present.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary states the patient was admitted for biliary obstruction (due to new primary cholangiocarcinoma) with hyperbilirubinemia and required PTBD drain exchange. However, the specific date \\'4/21/23\\' is not mentioned anywhere in the text. Additionally, while the biliary obstruction is malignant (from cholangiocarcinoma), it is described as a \\'new primary\\' rather than a \\'recurrent\\' event, which introduces ambiguity in terminology. The core elements (malignant obstruction, hyperbilirubinemia, PTBD exchange) are present, but the absence of the exact date and the nuanced distinction between \\'recurrent\\' versus \\'new primary\\' mean the fact as phrased is not fully captured.\\n\\n\\n\\n**49. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze this step by step: 1. The summary mentions that the patient had persistent hyperbilirubinemia and underwent PTBD interventions. 2. The summary indicates that the patient was transitioned to hospice care (specifically Sequoia Hospice). 3. However, while both elements (PTBD and transition to hospice) are present, the causal relationship that bilirubin specifically did not improve despite PTBD exchange, leading to the hospice decision is not explicitly stated. 4. The summary shows these as separate events without explicitly connecting them or stating that PTBD failed to improve bilirubin levels. 5. While we can infer this might have been the case (given the \\'persistent hyperbilirubinemia\\' mention), the specific fact that bilirubin failed to improve despite PTBD exchange leading to the hospice decision is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**50. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, the specific fact is not fully mentioned as stated. Let\\'s break down the components: 1. Sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation: While the summary mentions \\'empiric antibiotics for possible cholangitis\\' and \\'IV fluid boluses\\' for hypotension and dehydration, it does not explicitly state the patient had sepsis. 2. Delirium requiring pharmacotherapy: The summary mentions \\'delirium\\' but does not specify that it required pharmacotherapy. 3. Urinary retention requiring urinary catheter: While \\'low urine output\\' is mentioned under Problem #4, there is no mention of urinary retention or catheter placement. While some elements are partially present (fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, delirium, low urine output), the complete constellation of complications as specified in the fact is not explicitly documented in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed to determine if it explicitly mentioned that the hospital course was complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter. The summary indicates the patient received \\'empiric antibiotics for possible cholangitis\\' and \\'IV fluid boluses\\' for dehydration and hypotension, which suggests treatment similar to sepsis management. It also mentions the patient experienced \\'delirium\\' and was given \\'low dose mirtazapine\\' which can be considered a pharmacotherapy. Additionally, the patient had \\'low urine output,\\' but there\\'s no explicit mention of urinary retention or the use of a urinary catheter. The presence of sepsis treatment and delirium management is noted, but urinary retention requiring catheterization is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Sepsis: The summary mentions \\'empiric antibiotics for possible cholangitis\\' and \\'IV fluid boluses\\' for hypotension/dehydration, but does not explicitly state \\'sepsis\\' as a complication. Antibiotics and fluids are contextually related to cholangitis management rather than explicitly labeled as sepsis treatment. 2. Delirium: The summary explicitly states the patient \\'experienced delirium\\' but does not mention pharmacotherapy for delirium. Mirtazapine was used for appetite stimulation, not delirium management. 3. Urinary retention: The summary notes \\'low urine output\\' but attributes it to dehydration/poor intake rather than urinary retention. No mention of urinary catheter placement for retention is found. Conclusion: While related elements exist, none of the three components of the fact are explicitly stated as described.\\n\\n\\n\\n**51. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I find that while several related elements are mentioned (nasopharyngeal carcinoma, delirium, and outpatient follow up with oncology), the specific fact about deferring management of metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma to outpatient oncology due to the son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium is not explicitly stated. The summary mentions: 1. The patient has nasopharyngeal carcinoma with bilateral cervical nodal metastatic disease 2. The patient experienced delirium requiring Ativan and Zyprexa 3. There is a scheduled oncology follow up appointment However, nowhere does it explicitly state that management was deferred to outpatient oncology specifically due to the son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium. While oncology follow up is mentioned, the reasoning behind this decision and the son\\'s involvement in the decision making process are not documented in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission and treatment for failure to thrive and significant weight loss due to nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The summary includes various sections such as a one liner, brief description of hospital course, outstanding issues/follow up, and a problem based summary. To determine if the specific fact \\'Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium\\' is mentioned, we need to examine the provided text closely. The \\'Brief Description of Hospital Course\\' section mentions the patient\\'s diagnosis and treatment, including the placement of a PEG tube for nutritional needs. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' section details the patient\\'s nasopharyngeal carcinoma, including diagnostic investigations and therapeutic procedures. However, there is no explicit mention that the management of the patient\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was deferred to an outpatient oncologist due to the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and the patient\\'s delirium. The \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\' under \\'Problem #1: Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma\\' mentions that \\'Chemotherapy planning is ongoing,\\' which implies some level of planning for the carcinoma\\'s management but does not directly state that it was deferred to an outpatient oncologist per the son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium. Therefore, the specific fact is not explicitly mentioned in the provided summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) Searched for mentions of deferring management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The discharge plan under Problem #1 states \\'Chemotherapy planning is ongoing\\' but does not explicitly mention deferral to outpatient oncology. 2) Looked for family involvement in decision making no references to the son\\'s wishes appear in any section. 3) Checked delirium documentation while delirium is documented as a problem with improved status, there\\'s no connection made between delirium and oncology management decisions. 4) The outpatient oncology follow up is listed under \\'Outstanding Issues\\' but without any indication that active management decisions were deferred to them during hospitalization. While components of the fact exist separately (presence of metastatic NPC, outpatient oncology follow up, and delirium), the specific linkage of deferring management due to son\\'s wishes and delirium is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**52. Patient 29, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step: 1. The summary mentions that \\'The patient also experienced delirium and aspiration,\\' indicating there was an aspiration event. 2. However, while aspiration is mentioned, there is no explicit mention of: Development of oxygen requirement The oxygen requirement being temporary The oxygen requirement being attributed to aspiration pneumonitis Being made NPO by SLP (Speech Language Pathology) 3. While it\\'s common for aspiration to lead to oxygen requirements and NPO status, the text does not explicitly state these specific consequences or interventions. 4. The text does mention dysphagia and eventual PEG placement, but these are discussed in the context of the patient\\'s underlying cancer rather than as a response to aspiration pneumonitis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient experienced aspiration, which is related to the fact that the patient developed a temporary O2 requirement felt to be the result of aspiration pneumonitis. However, the summary does not explicitly state that the patient developed a temporary O2 requirement or that it was due to aspiration pneumonitis. It also does not mention being made strict NPO by SLP. The closest relevant information is that the patient experienced aspiration and was eventually made NPO implicitly by having a PEG placed for tube feeding due to dysphagia.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions the patient experienced aspiration and had a PEG placed for persistent dysphagia, but it does not explicitly state: 1) a temporary oxygen requirement, 2) a link between oxygen needs and aspiration pneumonitis, or 3) SLP directed NPO status. While aspiration is noted, the delirium section only describes secretions and agitation management. The NPO status is implied through PEG placement but not explicitly attributed to SLP recommendations. The term \\'pneumonitis\\' and oxygen requirements are absent from the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n### B.

All Inconsistent Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 0, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left-sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions \\'drains removed as she recovered\\' in the Outstanding Issues/Follow Up section 2. This directly contradicts the Important Fact stating a \\'Left sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge\\' 3. Both statements cannot be true either the drains were removed during recovery or a JP drain remained at discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions that \\'The patient had a wound vac and drains removed as she recovered.\\' This indicates that all drains were removed before discharge. The Important Fact states \\'Left sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge,\\' which contradicts the information given in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section states \\'Wound care and follow up: The patient had a wound vac and drains removed as she recovered.\\' 2. The Important Fact specifies a \\'Left sided abdominal JP drain left at time of discharge.\\' 3. The summary explicitly states drains were removed during recovery, which directly contradicts the claim that a drain remained at discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 4, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient had AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) on CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease) due to urinary retention, treated with Foley catheter placement. The Hospital Course Summary under \\'CKD IV and Urinary Retention\\' section states that the patient had urinary retention, was treated with Foley catheter placement, and had stable kidney function. The summary does not explicitly mention AKI, but it implies that the kidney function was \\'likely at baseline\\' and \\'stable\\', suggesting there wasn\\'t an acute deterioration (AKI) mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states AKI on CKD due to urinary retention treated with foley. 2. The summary states \\'CKD IV\\' and \\'kidney function likely at baseline\\' under CKD/retention section. 3. AKI implies acute deterioration from baseline, but the summary explicitly states kidney function was at baseline. 4. Both statements (AKI vs baseline function) cannot be true simultaneously.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states adrenal crisis was likely due to PO prednisone intolerance. 2. Hospital Summary documents treatment with IV hydrocortisone and discharge plan for PO hydrocortisone (25 mg q12h). 3. No mention of prednisone use or intolerance in the Summary. 4. Hydrocortisone and prednisone are distinct glucocorticoids; the Summary\\'s exclusive use of hydrocortisone contradicts the Fact\\'s attribution to prednisone intolerance.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions the patient is being discharged on Levemir 16 UNITS BID (twice daily) 2. The fact states insulin was changed to Lantus 15 units twice daily 3. These are different insulins (Levemir vs Lantus) and different doses (16 units vs 15 units) 4. While both are long acting insulins given twice daily, the specific medication and dosage differences constitute a clear contradiction\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions that the patient was discharged on \\'Levemir 16 UNITS BID and Insulin 1:7 TID AC\\' for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus management. The Important Fact states that insulin was changed to \\'lantus 15units twice a day\\'. Lantus and Levemir are both long acting insulins but are different products. The dosage and frequency mentioned in the summary (Levemir 16 units BID) contradict the fact (Lantus 15 units twice a day) because they refer to different insulin types and dosages.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states insulin was changed to Lantus 15 units BID. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s discharge plan for T1DM specifies \\'Levemir 16 UNITS BID\\' (Problem #3). 3. Lantus (insulin glargine) and Levemir (insulin detemir) are different basal insulins. 4. Different insulin types/doses in discharge plan directly contradict the stated fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 6, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Vitamin D deficiency, started on replacement, fat soluble vitamins sent, need to follow-up \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states Vitamin D deficiency was addressed with replacement started. 2. The Hospital Summary\\'s \\'Outstanding Issues\\' lists \\'Vitamin levels check: A, D, E, K...\\' indicating testing was pending, not completed. 3. No documentation of Vitamin D replacement being administered during admission in therapeutic procedures. 4. Fat soluble vitamin testing aligns with malabsorption workup but doesn\\'t confirm replacement was initiated. 5. Discharge medications lack Vitamin D supplementation, contradicting the \\'started on replacement\\' claim.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 7, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Left renal cell carcinoma status-post neoadjuvant chemotherapy and now post-op left nephrectomy, IVC thrombectomy. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\' prior to nephrectomy/IVC thrombectomy. 2. Hospital Course Summary describes surgical intervention (left nephrectomy and tumor thrombectomy) but never mentions neoadjuvant chemotherapy in: Problem #1 therapeutic procedures Relevant Medical History Any other sections 3. Omission of this key pretreatment directly contradicts the stated chemotherapy history in the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 7, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second-line\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact mentions a hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo and switch to cabozantinib. 2. The Hospital Course Summary documents renal cell carcinoma treatment via surgery (nephrectomy/tumor thrombectomy) but contains no references to immunotherapy (ipi/nivo), hypersensitivity reactions, or cabozantinib use. 3. Post op complications (hypotension/delirium) are explicitly attributed to surgical causes, with no documentation of drug related adverse events. 4. Discharge medications include apixaban but no cancer therapies, further confirming the absence of documented immunotherapy or cabozantinib use. These omissions create a direct contradiction with the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The hospital course summary does not mention any aspiration event prior to discharge 2. While the summary mentions positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus (which are GPCs), it specifically notes this was from sputum culture, not bottle cultures 3. The summary mentions pending lab sensitivities for S. aureus but does not mention any other pending culture results 4. The timing and nature of the cultures described in the summary are different from the fact\\'s description of bottle cultures 5. The summary describes a stable discharge without complications, which differs from the fact\\'s mention of an aspiration event\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows the patient was treated with Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam) and is being discharged to continue Zosyn for 7 10 days, while the fact states Cipro treatment. 2. The summary confirms finasteride use, matching the fact. 3. Both documents agree on urinary source sepsis/infection with pyelonephritis. 4. However, the antibiotic discrepancy (Zosyn vs. Cipro) represents a clear contradiction, as these are different treatment regimens for the same infection episode.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient was finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge. However, the Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was treated with Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam) and initially Vancomycin, and was discharged with plans to continue Zosyn for a total of 7 10 days. The antibiotic mentioned in the Important Fact (cipro) does not match the antibiotic mentioned in the Hospital Course Summary (Zosyn). This discrepancy indicates a clear conflict between the Important Fact and the Hospital Course Summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states patient was \\'finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge.\\' 2. Hospital Summary discharge plan specifies \\'Continue Zosyn (piperacillin tazobactam) for total 7 10 days\\' with no mention of cipro. 3. Ciprofloxacin and Zosyn are distinct antibiotics; simultaneous use isn\\'t documented. 4. Finasteride initiation is consistent in both documents. The antibiotic discrepancy creates irreconcilable conflict.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 11, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient had orthostatic hypotension and was fluid resuscitated \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital summary states the patient had orthostatic hypotension. 2. However, there is no mention of fluid resuscitation in any section (Brief Description, Therapeutic Procedures, Discharge Plans). 3. The absence of documented fluid resuscitation in the summary directly contradicts the fact stating it occurred. 4. Both cannot be true simultaneously as fluid resuscitation is a specific intervention that would be recorded if performed.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 12, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient sent to the hospital from home for symptoms of tachycardia, hypotension, found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula\\n\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states the patient was sent to the hospital for tachycardia/hypotension and subsequently found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s \\'Brief Description\\' explicitly states the patient \\'presented with... a new fistula involving the gallbladder\\' upon admission. 3. This indicates the fistula was part of the presenting problem (not discovered during hospitalization), directly contradicting the Important Fact\\'s sequence of events.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 12, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was started on empiric antibiotics but was found to have a normal WBC with normal lactate and abx were discontinued, he was not discharged on antibiotics\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states antibiotics were started then discontinued due to normal WBC/lactate. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' lists IV fluids and Narcan but no antibiotics. 3. Discharge plan under Problem #1 specifies continuing home medications (aspirin/metoprolol) but no antibiotics. 4. No documentation of antibiotic initiation or discontinuation in the entire summary. 5. Summary\\'s omission of antibiotic administration directly conflicts with the fact\\'s explicit timeline.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary directly contradicts the statement that the post operative course was \\'unremarkable\\' 2. The summary describes multiple post operative complications: Blistering on coccyx Possible adhesive reaction Episodes of hypertension and tachycardia Required ketamine and lidocaine drips for pain control Experienced blurry vision Had a panic attack 3. These complications indicate a complex rather than unremarkable post operative course\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient experienced post operative complications including hypertension, tachycardia, blistering on her coccyx, and a panic attack, which contradicts the Important Fact stating that the patient had an \\'unremarkable post operative course\\'. The presence of these complications makes the summary inconsistent with the fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'unremarkable post operative course\\'. 2. Summary lists multiple post operative complications: blistering on coccyx, possible reaction to adhesive, hypertension, tachycardia, blurry vision, and panic attack. 3. These documented complications directly contradict the characterization of the post op course as \\'unremarkable\\'. 4. Both cannot be true simultaneously.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions that the patient experienced episodes of hypertension post operatively. The patient has a history of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) as listed under Relevant Medical History. The presence of hypertension post operatively could indicate a worsening of her chronic condition. The Important Fact states that her chronic medical conditions, including DM2, were not worsened perioperatively. The summary\\'s mention of hypertension episodes contradicts this fact because it suggests that her hypertension was potentially worsened or exacerbated during the perioperative period.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 14, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Dexamethasone taper was started\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'Dexamethasone taper was started.\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary under Problem #1\\'s Therapeutic Procedures states \\'dexamethasone 20 mg IV x1 then 4 mg q6h IV\\' with no mention of dose reduction or tapering schedule. 3. A taper implies gradual dose reduction, but the summary only documents a fixed maintenance dose (4 mg q6h) after an initial bolus, indicating no active tapering process.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The hospital course summary indicates the patient was admitted for acute kidney injury (AKI) with nausea and vomiting, likely causing hypovolemia. 2. The summary discusses resolution of nausea/vomiting but attributes it to hypovolemia and AKI, not viral gastroenteritis. 3. There is no mention of viral etiology or testing for viral infections. 4. The workup and treatment focused on renal issues, fluid status, and transplant related care. 5. The clinical presentation and course described is inconsistent with viral gastroenteritis being the principal diagnosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis. 2. Hospital Summary attributes AKI to hypovolemia from nausea/vomiting but does not specify viral gastroenteritis as the cause. 3. Summary explicitly states patient was evaluated for infection but \\'did not meet SIRS criteria\\' with negative blood cultures, which contradicts an infectious (viral) etiology. 4. No mention of stool studies, viral testing, or clinical features supporting gastroenteritis in the summary. 5. Discharge diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis directly conflicts with documented lack of infectious workup confirmation and attribution to hypovolemia/ATN.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 16, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Currently on high dose dexamethasone and Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states the patient is on Bactrim for PJP prophylaxis. 2. Hospital Summary lists current medications (palbociclib, fulvestrant, Xgeva, levothyroxine) and specifically mentions dexamethasone 4mg BID, but contains no reference to Bactrim. 3. Since Bactrim use is not documented in any medication lists or therapeutic procedures, this creates a direct contradiction with the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 17, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Delirium tremens requiring intravenous benzodiazepines and phenobarbital for symptom control\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'delirium tremens\\' requiring IV benzodiazepines and phenobarbital. 2. The Hospital Summary describes \\'acute ethanol withdrawal with perceptual disturbances\\' treated with CIWA protocol (Ativan) and phenobarbital, but never uses the term \\'delirium tremens\\'. 3. Delirium tremens is a specific severe form of withdrawal requiring autonomic instability and altered consciousness, which are not explicitly documented in the summary. 4. The summary\\'s diagnosis (\\'alcohol withdrawal syndrome with perceptual disturbances\\') and absence of delirium tremens terminology directly conflict with the Important Fact\\'s assertion of DT.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary indicates the patient\\'s fever resolved after antibiotic treatment 2. Infectious workup was negative (blood cultures and other tests) 3. The summary attributes the fever to a likely tumor fever due to lymphoma 4. While both the fact and summary mention negative infectious workup, they differ in that: The fact suggests persistent fever despite negative workup The summary clearly states the fever resolved 5. Therefore, these accounts cannot both be true one describes persistent fever, the other describes resolved fever\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient had fever, was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime), and had negative blood cultures and other infectious workup results. The summary also mentions that the fever resolved and that possible tumor fever due to lymphoma was considered as infectious causes were ruled out. The Important Fact states \\'Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups.\\' The summary contradicts this fact because it states that the fever resolved and there\\'s no clear indication of a suspected pulmonary infection; the CXR showed \\'low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis,\\' which does not directly indicate a pulmonary infection.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups.\\' 2. The Hospital Course explicitly states \\'fever resolved\\' and notes \\'blood cultures and other infectious workup results were negative.\\' 3. CXR findings (bibasilar atelectasis) are non infectious, and the summary attributes fever etiology to lymphoma (\\'possible tumor fever\\') after ruling out infections. 4. These statements directly contradict the claim of persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection in the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 18, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma recently complicated by progression to CNS lymphoma\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states \\'Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) recently complicated by progression to CNS lymphoma.\\' 2. The Hospital Summary specifies \\'de novo transformed high grade B cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 translocations\\' and documents CNS progression. 3. High grade B cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements is a distinct entity from DLBCL per WHO classification. 4. These diagnoses are mutually exclusive, as the genetic profile defines a separate category. 5. The summary\\'s diagnosis directly contradicts the Important Fact\\'s DLBCL classification.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 19, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Chronic opioid use and opioid-related constipation. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary lists \\'Chronic Opioid Use\\' (Problem #5) and \\'Chronic Constipation\\' (Problem #2) as separate issues. 2. The \\'Chronic Constipation\\' section does not mention opioid related etiology, instead recommending a bowel regimen without linking it to opioids. 3. The fact specifies \\'opioid related constipation,\\' implying causation, which the summary does not acknowledge. 4. The absence of a stated link between opioids and constipation in the summary creates a contradiction with the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 20, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** HHT with new PE/DVT s/p IVC filter placement as well as changed to fondaparinux\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states anticoagulation was \\'changed to fondaparinux\\'. 2. Hospital summary explicitly states \\'transitioned from fondaparinux to apixaban\\' in both the Brief Description and Problem #1 sections. 3. These are mutually exclusive therapeutic changes (fondaparinux vs apixaban). 4. The summary\\'s documentation of active anticoagulation with apixaban directly contradicts the fact\\'s claim of being on fondaparinux.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The Important Fact mentions \\'worsening thrombocytopenia\\' and \\'prednisone taper initiation\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary confirms thrombocytopenia (nadir of 42) and prednisone treatment 3. However, the summary indicates prednisone was actually increased (from 40mg to 100mg daily), not tapered 4. While the discharge plan mentions \\'continue prednisone taper\\', this refers to a future plan, not what occurred during the hospital course 5. The thrombocytopenia was being actively treated with increased doses, not worsening as stated in the fact\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The fact states \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation.\\' 2. The summary documents \\'progressive thrombocytopenia\\' but explicitly states \\'prednisone was increased to 100 mg daily\\' (not a taper) and \\'platelet count improving\\' under Problem #2. 3. Increasing prednisone dose contradicts a taper, and improving platelets contradict worsening thrombocytopenia. Both elements of the fact are directly negated in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary directly addresses the etiology of falls: Under Problem #2 \\'Recurrent Falls\\', it notes cardiac workup showed \\'No significant ECG changes or volume overload/clinical or lab findings\\' Patient had \\'few runs of nonsustained SVT\\' but without symptoms CT imaging revealed T6 compression fracture 2. This contradicts the fact stating falls were of \\'unknown etiology despite extensive workup\\' since: Clear cardiac monitoring results were documented Physical findings (compression fracture) were identified The workup yielded explanatory findings rather than being inconclusive\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states \\'CT Chest Abdomen Pelvis with IV Contrast showed a new interval anterior wedge compression deformity of T6\\' 2. The use of \\'new interval\\' in the description directly contradicts the fact that the T6 fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall\\' 3. The summary is clearly describing this as a new finding, while the fact indicates it was a pre existing condition\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that Mrs. Mallonee was found to have a \\'likely subacute T6 compression fracture\\' after several falls at home. The Problem Based Summary under \\'Problem #1: T6 Wedge Compression Fracture\\' mentions that the CT Chest Abdomen Pelvis with IV Contrast showed a \\'new interval anterior wedge compression deformity of T6.\\' The Important Fact states that there is a \\'T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall.\\' The summary indicates the fracture is \\'new interval\\' and \\'likely subacute,\\' suggesting it occurred recently, potentially around the time of the falls. This contradicts the Important Fact that the fracture likely happened before the most recent fall. Therefore, the summary is inconsistent with the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 21, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Increased to metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions under Problem #5: HFrEF that the patient was continued on \\'home Lasix and metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily.\\' This indicates that the patient was already on metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily before admission and it was continued during the hospital stay. The Important Fact states \\'Increased to metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily,\\' which implies a change in dosage. Since the summary does not mention any increase in dosage and instead indicates that the patient was already on 50 mg daily, it contradicts the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states metoprolol succinate was \\'increased to 50 mg daily.\\' 2. The Hospital Course Summary (Problem #5) specifies \\'continue home Lasix and metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily.\\' 3. \\'Continue\\' indicates no dose change occurred during hospitalization, conflicting with the claim of an increase. Both statements cannot be true simultaneously.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 22, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** patient should follow up with Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/ Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Poultsides, George, MD in in 2 weeks\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary does not mention a follow up appointment with an Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant) in 1 week. It also does not mention a follow up with Poultsides, George, MD in 2 weeks. The \\'Outstanding Issues/Follow Up\\' section lists several follow up plans but none match the specific follow up instructions given in the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 25, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact mentions that an Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum, and the patient was started on empiric PPI for 8 weeks. The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was treated with IV famotidine (later switched to PPI in the Important Fact) and had marked gastric distention, duodenitis, and was managed with a nasogastric tube for decompression. The presence of marked gastric distention and duodenitis suggests potential issues with the GI tract that contradict the absence of significant obstruction. Thus, the Hospital Course Summary implies complications that are not aligned with the \\'no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction\\' statement.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 26, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Metoprolol dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily for improved rate control; Apixaban dosage increased to 5 mg twice daily for anticoagulation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was discharged on metoprolol succinate 75 mg BID, which is consistent with the Important Fact stating that the Metoprolol dosage was increased to 75 mg twice daily. However, the summary does not mention the Apixaban dosage being increased to 5 mg twice daily; instead, it mentions the patient was on \\'reduced dose apixaban\\' upon admission and does not specify any change in Apixaban dosage during the hospital stay.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states apixaban dosage was increased to 5 mg twice daily. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s \\'One Liner\\' specifies the patient is on a reduced dose apixaban . 3. Discharge plan for atrial flutter management lists metoprolol 75 mg BID (consistent with the fact) but does not mention any apixaban dosage increase. 4. The summary\\'s explicit \\'reduced dose apixaban\\' directly conflicts with the fact\\'s \\'increased to 5 mg BID\\' (standard full dose).\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The Important Fact states emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia due to SMA stenosis. 2. The Hospital Summary under Problem #1 notes CT angiography showed \\'moderate narrowing of the proximal superior mesenteric artery\\' but explicitly states \\'no acute mesenteric ischemia\\'. 3. Chronic mesenteric ischemia (a separate entity from acute) is not mentioned in the summary as a diagnostic consideration or ruled out. 4. The summary attributes symptoms to gastroparesis/dyspepsia without addressing chronic ischemia as a potential contributor. 5. The presence of SMA stenosis in imaging supports the Important Fact\\'s hypothesis, but the summary neither confirms nor denies this link, creating a potential contradiction in diagnostic reasoning.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient was found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia. However, the Hospital Course Summary indicates that the blood cultures grew Coag Negative Staph bacteremia (mecA gene detected), not coagulase negative strep. This is a clear contradiction as \\'Coag Negative Staph\\' refers to coagulase negative Staphylococcus, which is different from coagulase negative Streptococcus. The specific mention of \\'Staph\\' versus \\'strep\\' indicates a different type of bacteria.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states bacteremia caused by \\'coagulase negative strep\\' (Streptococcus). 2. Hospital Summary reports \\'Coag Negative Staph bacteremia\\' (Staphylococcus) in blood cultures. 3. Streptococcus and Staphylococcus are distinct bacterial genera; cannot both be true. 4. Treatment with vancomycin/cefepime and PICC removal aligns with Staph management, but contradicts the stated pathogen in the Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 27, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions enlarged tonsils on CT maxillofacial (L>R), but does not indicate active tonsilitis 2. While antibiotics were given (zosyn, vancomycin, cefepime), they were administered for neutropenic fever and Coag Negative Staph bacteremia, not for tonsilitis 3. No localizing symptoms of tonsilitis are mentioned in the summary 4. The antibiotics were clearly tied to a different diagnosis (bacteremia) with a specific cultured organism\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'treated with antibiotics\\' for tonsillitis. 2. Hospital summary documents antibiotics (zosyn, vancomycin, cefepime, linezolid) but specifies they were given for neutropenic fever and Coag Negative Staph bacteremia. 3. CT showed \\'mild enlarged tonsils\\' but no mention of tonsillitis diagnosis or targeted treatment. 4. Antibiotic use aligns with bacteremia management, not explicitly for tonsillitis. 5. Contradiction exists between stated indication (tonsillitis) vs documented indication (bacteremia/neutropenic fever).\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'sepsis requiring antibiotics\\' Summary mentions \\'empiric antibiotics for possible cholangitis\\' (consistent). 2. Important Fact mentions \\'delirium requiring pharmacotherapy\\' Summary notes delirium but only lists mirtazapine for appetite, not delirium specific agents. 3. Important Fact cites \\'urinary retention requiring catheter\\' Summary documents low urine output but no mention of retention or catheter placement. The absence of documented pharmacotherapy and urinary catheter for retention creates contradictions.\\n\\n\\n\\n**34. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows active management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, including: PET/CT ordered for expedited workup Chemotherapy planning noted as \\'ongoing\\' Scheduled follow up appointments with Oncology 2. This contradicts the fact stating management was deferred to outpatient oncologist due to delirium and son\\'s wishes 3. While the summary mentions delirium (Problem #5), it\\'s described as a temporary condition that improved, not as a reason to defer cancer management 4. No mention of son\\'s wishes affecting treatment decisions anywhere in the summary\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the management of the patient\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was deferred to an outpatient oncologist per the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and the patient\\'s delirium. The Hospital Course Summary indicates that \\'Chemotherapy planning is ongoing\\' under the Discharge Plan and Goals for Problem #1: Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma. This implies that the management of the nasopharyngeal carcinoma was not entirely deferred, as some planning for chemotherapy was being done during the hospital stay. Therefore, the Hospital Course Summary contradicts the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states management of metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was deferred to outpatient oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium. 2. Hospital Summary under Problem #1\\'s Discharge Plan states \\'Chemotherapy planning is ongoing\\' without mentioning deferral to outpatient oncologist or son\\'s involvement. 3. The summary\\'s active chemotherapy planning directly contradicts the fact\\'s assertion that management was deferred, as both cannot be true simultaneously.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'deepseek-r1': '# Factual evaluation of the deepseek-r1 summarizer by a LLM jury\\n\\n## Jury members: claude-3.5-sonnet-v2, llama4-maverick, deepseek-r1\\n\\n## Main results\\n\\n### A. Presence of important facts\\n\\n**Score: 62/100** (95% CI: 51-71) (higher values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the important facts missing:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries frequently omit critical clinical details due to recurring patterns: (1) **Procedural incompleteness**, where specific surgical steps (e.g., Patient 2’s adhesiolysis) or diagnostic specifics (e.g., Patient 4’s deferred GI biopsy vs. EUS/FNA) are excluded despite related elements being documented. (2) **Terminology mismatches**, such as referencing \"Levemir\" instead of \"Lantus\" (Patient 6) or attributing AKI to urinary retention without explicit causality (Patient 4). (3) **Medication ambiguities**, including unrecorded changes (Patient 7’s missing ipi/nivo reaction) or dosing discrepancies (Patient 26’s metoprolol frequency vs. total dose). (4) **Diagnostic omissions**, where clinical findings like alcohol ketosis (Patient 10) or sepsis sources (Patient 18) lack explicit labeling despite contextual evidence. (5) **Inconsistent follow-up documentation**, such as absent 4-week TPN follow-up (Patient 12) or unmentioned specialist appointments (Patient 22). (6) **Unreported results**, including pending cultures (Patient 8’s GPC) or resolved conditions (Patient 28’s improving bilirubin misrepresented as static). These patterns highlight systemic gaps in granularity, terminology precision, and explicit linkage of clinical events, compromising summary comprehensiveness.\\n\\n### B. Hospital course summaries contradicting important facts\\n\\n**Score: 16/100** (95% CI: 8-24) (lower values better)\\n\\n**Feedback regarding the inconsistencies:**\\n\\nHospital course summaries often exhibit inconsistencies with clinical facts due to recurring patterns, including **medication regimen discrepancies** (Patient 6: Levemir vs. Lantus insulin), **conflicting diagnostic data** (Patient 8: pending blood cultures vs. reported GPC positivity; Patient 27: *Staphylococcus* vs. *Streptococcus* bacteremia), and **diagnostic certainty mismatches** (Patient 12: \"suspected\" vs. \"confirmed\" gallbladder fistula). **Treatment contradictions** arise when summaries omit or contradict therapies (Patient 9: Zosyn vs. ciprofloxacin; Patient 28: improved vs. unchanged bilirubin post-PTBD). **Underreported complications** occur when summaries document significant issues omitted in facts (Patient 13: hypertensive urgency, hyperglycemia vs. \"unremarkable\" course). **Medication management errors** include conflicting dosing (Patient 26: metoprolol 37.5 mg q6h vs. 75 mg BID) or continuation/cessation status (Patient 15: tacrolimus continued vs. stopped). **Lab monitoring conflicts** (Patient 20: weekly vs. twice-weekly CBCs) and **misattributed clinical decisions** (Patient 29: active radiation planning vs. deferred care) further highlight inconsistencies. These patterns reflect documentation inaccuracies, terminology confusion, and divergent interpretations of diagnostic certainty.\\n\\n## Detailed results\\n\\n### A.

All Missing Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 2, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed. Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, while it mentions \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' was performed (in section 7: Therapeutic Procedures Performed), it does not explicitly mention the specific surgical details about taking down adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall or removing obstructing necrotic mass. While we know there was a necrotic mass (mentioned in the CT findings as \\'8.3 cm necrotic small bowel mass\\'), and the surgery was performed, the specific technical details of the procedure described in the fact are not mentioned in the summary. The summary focuses more on the general procedure name and outcomes rather than the specific surgical steps. Therefore, while related elements are present, the specific fact as stated is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'laparoscopic small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' under Therapeutic Procedures Performed, which directly matches the second part of the fact. However, there is no mention of \\'adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall being taken down\\' or explicit reference to \\'obstructing necrotic mass removal\\' in any section. While the resection of a \\'necrotic small bowel metastasis\\' is documented, the specific phrasing about adhesions or an \\'obstructing necrotic mass\\' is absent. The absence of these specific descriptors leads to the conclusion that the full fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 3, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** LLQ abdominal pain 2/2 cancer\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'recurrent left lower quadrant abdominal pain\\' under \\'Reason for Admission\\' and lists \\'Functional abdominal pain with IBS features\\' as a secondary diagnosis. However, it does not explicitly state that the LLQ abdominal pain is due to cancer. The summary does mention \\'Progressive metastatic adenocarcinoma\\' and various related complications, but the direct causation between cancer and LLQ abdominal pain is not clearly stated. The closest related information is under \\'Problem #1: Metastatic Adenocarcinoma Pain\\', which discusses breakthrough pain managed with PRN hydromorphone, suggesting a link between pain and cancer, but it does not specifically mention LLQ abdominal pain being caused by cancer.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 4, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pancreatic tail mass leading to outpatient GI biopsy\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I can see that while a pancreatic tail mass is clearly documented (2.9 cm cystic lesion/IPMN), there is no explicit mention of an outpatient GI biopsy being performed. The summary indicates that an EUS/FNA (endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration) is planned for outpatient follow up, but this is noted as pending rather than completed. Specifically: 1. The mass is described in the Primary Diagnosis section as a \\'2.9 cm pancreatic tail cystic lesion\\' 2. Under Problem #1, it states \\'Outpatient EUS/FNA\\' is part of the discharge plan 3. The patient \\'Declined inpatient scheduling for endoscopic ultrasound/fine needle aspiration (EUS/FNA)\\' 4. No previous or completed GI biopsy is mentioned anywhere in the summary\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions a pancreatic tail cystic lesion (2.9 cm) consistent with side branch intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) with high risk stigmata. The summary also states that the patient declined inpatient scheduling for endoscopic ultrasound/fine needle aspiration (EUS/FNA) and that outpatient EUS/FNA and surgical oncology consultation are planned. However, it does not explicitly mention a \\'pancreatic tail mass leading to outpatient GI biopsy.\\' While it implies that further investigation is needed for the pancreatic mass, it specifies EUS/FNA rather than a GI biopsy. Therefore, the specific fact of a \\'pancreatic tail mass leading to outpatient GI biopsy\\' is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 4, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Analyzing the hospital course summary step by step: 1. The summary mentions CKD IV as a pre existing condition (baseline Cr 3.8) 2. Urinary retention is explicitly mentioned as a reason for admission and is treated with Foley catheter placement (documented in both Format 1 and Format 2) 3. However, while both CKD and urinary retention with Foley placement are present, the summary does not explicitly state that the patient experienced AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) on top of their CKD 4. In fact, the summary notes that the creatinine remained at baseline levels (Cr 3.6 3.8) 5. While azilsartan was held due to \\'borderline AKI,\\' this doesn\\'t constitute a clear diagnosis of AKI 6. The causal relationship between urinary retention and kidney injury is not explicitly established in the text\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The summary mentions CKD IV (baseline Cr 3.8) in the medical history and Problem #4. 2. AKI is referenced in the medications section where azilsartan was held \\'due to borderline AKI.\\' 3. Urinary retention requiring Foley placement (11/6 11/9) is documented in the admission reason and Problem #2. However, there is no explicit statement linking AKI to urinary retention as a cause (2/2 relationship). While all components (AKI, CKD, urinary retention, Foley) are present separately, the causal relationship between AKI and urinary retention is not explicitly stated. The AKI reference appears related to medication management rather than being attributed to retention.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions adrenal crisis in the context of primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS Type 2). However, the summary attributes the adrenal crisis to being \\'precipitated by gastrointestinal illness\\' rather than \\'intolerance of PO prednisone.\\' While the summary documents the patient\\'s transition from IV hydrocortisone to PO prednisone during treatment, there is no explicit mention of prednisone intolerance as a contributing factor. The adrenal crisis etiology is linked to a GI illness (likely causing malabsorption/stress), and the chronic management challenges are noted without specifying medication intolerance. Thus, the \\'likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone\\' component of the fact is absent.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze this step by step: 1. The summary mentions Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) in the medical history section under \\'Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2\\' 2. Regarding insulin changes, the summary mentions: Discontinuation of insulin drip in the Medications section Patient being \\'Normoglycemic on Levemir insulin\\' at discharge 3. However, there is no explicit mention of: Lantus insulin A specific dosage of 15 units Twice daily administration While the summary indicates the patient has T1DM and is on insulin therapy (specifically Levemir), it does not mention the specific fact about changing to Lantus 15 units twice daily. Therefore, this specific fact is not explicitly present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnoses, treatments, and discharge plans. The patient has Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) as part of Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2. The summary mentions that the patient was on an \\'insulin drip\\' during hospitalization, which was discontinued. At discharge, the patient was on \\'Levemir insulin\\' with the note that they were \\'Normoglycemic.\\' The specific fact to look for is \\'Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\' The summary does not explicitly mention \\'Lantus\\' (a brand name for insulin glargine) or the specific dosage \\'15units twice a day.\\' It mentions \\'Levemir insulin,\\' which is a different long acting insulin (insulin detemir), not Lantus. Therefore, the exact fact is not mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. The hospital course summary explicitly mentions Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in the \\'Relevant Medical History\\' section under Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2. 2. The \\'Medications\\' section notes that the insulin drip was discontinued, and the discharge condition states the patient is \\'normoglycemic on Levemir insulin.\\' 3. The specific fact in question (\\'insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day\\') is not present. While insulin management is addressed, the summary specifies Levemir (insulin detemir) rather than Lantus (insulin glargine), and no dosage of 15 units BID is documented. 4. Clinical synonyms or abbreviations for Lantus (e.g., \\'glargine\\') are absent, and the described insulin regimen does not match the fact\\'s details. The absence of both the medication name and specific dosing regimen confirms the fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 7, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second-line\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing both the standard section based summary and problem based summary formats, there is no explicit mention of a hypersensitivity reaction to ipi/nivo (ipilimumab/nivolumab) or a switch to cabozantinib as second line therapy. The only cancer treatment mentioned is neoadjuvant chemotherapy (non specific) and the surgical intervention (left radical nephrectomy with IVC thrombectomy). While the patient\\'s cancer history and treatment are discussed, particularly in sections 1, 2, and 4, there is no reference to immunotherapy complications or changes in systemic therapy. The medications section (8) and problem list do not include any immunotherapy agents or cabozantinib.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, medical history, surgical history, primary and secondary diagnoses, diagnostic investigations, therapeutic procedures, medications, and condition at discharge. To determine if the fact \\'Hypersensitivity (?) reaction to ipi/nivo, switched to cabozantinib second line\\' is mentioned, we need to look for any reference to \\'ipi/nivo\\' (ipilimumab/nivolumab), a hypersensitivity reaction, or the switch to \\'cabozantinib\\'. Upon reviewing the provided summary, there is no mention of \\'ipi/nivo\\', \\'hypersensitivity reaction\\', or \\'cabozantinib\\' in any section, including the relevant medical history, medications, or discharge plans. The summary focuses on the patient\\'s renal cell carcinoma treatment with surgery and postoperative care, without referencing the specific fact in question.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was analyzed in detail. Key sections reviewed include: Relevant Medical History, Medications, Therapeutic Procedures, and Problem Based Summary. There is no mention of immunotherapy agents ipilimumab (ipi) or nivolumab (nivo) anywhere in the document. The summary describes neoadjuvant chemotherapy but does not specify agents used. Cabozantinib is not referenced in any medication lists or treatment plans. No documentation of hypersensitivity reactions (by name, abbreviation, or clinical synonyms like \\'allergic reaction\\' or \\'adverse drug reaction\\') appears in any complication lists or problem summaries. The second line therapy switch described in the fact is entirely absent from both the standard and problem based summaries.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 8, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Down\\'s syndrome, neurogenic bladder, admitted for pneumonia, treated with CAP regimen and vancomycin due to positive sputum culture for MRSA\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Down\\'s syndrome is explicitly mentioned in the \\'Reason for Admission\\' and \\'Relevant Medical History\\' sections. 2. Neurogenic bladder is documented in the \\'Relevant Medical History\\' and as a secondary diagnosis. 3. Admission for pneumonia is clearly stated as the primary diagnosis. 4. The CAP regimen (ceftriaxone + azithromycin) is listed under therapeutic procedures. 5. Vancomycin was administered (06/01 06/05) but discontinued after MSSA confirmation. The sputum culture showed Staphylococcus aureus, but MRSA was only suspected via nares PCR (later disproven). The summary does not explicitly state a positive sputum culture for MRSA as the reason for vancomycin use, making this component of the fact unmentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed both formats of the hospital course summary, focusing on any mentions of aspiration events or blood culture results. While the summary does mention blood cultures were drawn on 06/06/2023 and were pending at discharge, it does not specifically mention that 1/4 bottles were positive for GPC (Gram positive cocci) or any potential aspiration event prior to discharge. The only blood culture information provided states \\'Blood cultures (06/06/2023): Pending at discharge\\' in section 6 and is referenced again as \\'Outstanding/Pending Issues: Final blood culture results pending (drawn 06/06/2023)\\' in the problem based summary. There is no mention of preliminary results showing GPC or any aspiration events. While the patient has a history of dysphagia and G tube placement, no acute aspiration events are documented in the course.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, treatment, and discharge. To determine if the fact \\'Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\' is mentioned, we need to look for any reference to aspiration, blood culture results, or Gram positive cocci (GPC) in the summary. The summary mentions that \\'Blood cultures (06/06/2023): Pending at discharge\\' under Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results, and \\'Outstanding/Pending Issues: Final blood culture results pending (drawn 06/06/2023)\\' under Problem #1. However, it does not specify the results of the blood cultures or mention GPC or speciation. Therefore, the specific fact about aspiration event, positive GPC cultures, and pending speciation is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention a potential aspiration event prior to discharge. While the patient has chronic dysphagia (a risk factor for aspiration), the summary attributes the respiratory failure to pneumonia without specifying aspiration as a cause. Additionally, the summary notes blood cultures were pending at discharge but does not report any positive results (e.g., \\'1/4 bottles positive for GPC\\'). The sputum culture identified Staphylococcus aureus, but this is distinct from the specific fact about blood culture bottles with GPC and incomplete speciation. No equivalent phrasing or clinical synonyms for the stated fact are present in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the text step by step: 1. The summary mentions sepsis with urinary source (\"Klebsiella UTI/Pyelonephritis with Sepsis\") 2. However, the specific antibiotic mentioned is Zosyn, not Cipro 3. There\\'s no mention of a 7 day course of Cipro being completed or planned 4. Finasteride is indeed started (\"Newly Started: Finasteride 5 mg QHS\") and is specifically linked to prostatomegaly, which is noted as a \"suspected contributor to recurrent UTIs\" 5. While the core concept of treating sepsis from a urinary source and starting finasteride to prevent future UTIs is present, the specific detail about completing a 7 day course of Cipro is not mentioned anywhere in the text. The antibiotic therapy described is different (Zosyn).\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient had Klebsiella pneumoniae urinary tract infection with pyelonephritis and sepsis associated encephalopathy, indicating sepsis from a urinary source with potential pyelonephritis. The summary also states that Finasteride was newly started for prostatomegaly, which is suspected to be a contributor to recurrent UTIs, in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. However, the antibiotic course mentioned at discharge is Zosyn, not cipro, and it is guided by final culture sensitivities. The duration of the Zosyn course is not explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1. Sepsis from urinary source with pyelonephritis : Explicitly stated in the Primary Diagnosis\\' as \\'Klebsiella pneumoniae urinary tract infection with pyelonephritis and sepsis associated encephalopathy\\' and in Problem #1 as \\'Klebsiella UTI/Pyelonephritis with Sepsis\\'. 2. 7 day cipro course on discharge : The summary specifies antibiotic therapy was \\'Vancomycin transitioned to Zosyn\\' with a discharge plan to \\'complete Zosyn course\\'. No mention of ciprofloxacin (cipro) at any point in treatment or discharge medications. 3. Finasteride initiation for UTI prevention : Explicitly documented in Medications (\\'Newly Started: Finasteride 5 mg QHS\\') and in Problem #4\\'s discharge plan, which links prostatomegaly to recurrent UTIs. Conclusion: While sepsis/pyelonephritis and finasteride initiation are clearly documented, the specified 7 day cipro course is absent (Zosyn is used instead). Since the fact requires all three components, the missing cipro element makes the full fact unmentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 10, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** The patient had alcohol ketosis on presentation \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary in both formats, there is no explicit mention of alcohol ketosis on presentation. While the summary extensively details the patient\\'s alcohol use disorder, withdrawal syndrome, and various metabolic derangements, it does not specifically mention ketosis. The metabolic issues discussed include electrolyte abnormalities requiring K Phos and MgSO4 repletion, but ketosis is not listed among the presenting conditions, laboratory findings, or diagnoses. The primary reason for admission is clearly stated as alcohol withdrawal syndrome with CIWA >15, and while various complications of alcohol use are documented (including liver injury and thrombocytopenia), ketosis is not among them.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'alcohol ketosis\\' on presentation. The summary discusses the patient\\'s alcohol withdrawal syndrome, polysubstance use disorder, and mixed liver injury, among other issues. While it mentions \\'metabolic derangements\\' in the conclusion, it does not specify \\'alcohol ketosis.\\' The presence of \\'ketosis\\' is not indicated in any of the laboratory results or clinical descriptions provided in the summary. Therefore, the fact of having \\'alcohol ketosis on presentation\\' is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'alcohol ketosis\\' or equivalent terms. While the patient has documented alcohol withdrawal syndrome and polysubstance use (including 1L vodka/week), the summary focuses on withdrawal management, liver injury, and thrombocytopenia. Key sections like \\'Primary Diagnosis,\\' \\'Secondary Diagnoses,\\' and \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\' lack references to ketosis, ketones, or metabolic acidosis. The conclusion mentions \\'resolution of metabolic derangements,\\' but this is nonspecific and could refer to electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., potassium/phosphate repletion documented in therapy). No lab values (e.g., serum/urine ketones, anion gap) or clinical findings supporting ketosis are present. Alcohol related complications are discussed, but not ketosis specifically.\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 12, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was started on empiric antibiotics but was found to have a normal WBC with normal lactate and abx were discontinued, he was not discharged on antibiotics\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I searched for mentions of antibiotics, WBC counts, lactate levels, and antibiotic discontinuation. The summary does not explicitly mention any of these elements. While there is mention of an \\'infectious workup evaluation\\' in the Reason for Admission section and a note about \\'RUQ fluid collection without active infection\\' in Problem #1, there is no specific mention of: 1. Starting empiric antibiotics 2. Normal WBC count 3. Normal lactate level 4. Discontinuation of antibiotics 5. Antibiotic status at discharge The fact requires all these elements to be present, but none are explicitly stated in either the standard section based summary or the problem based summary formats.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention that the patient was started on empiric antibiotics, had a normal WBC with normal lactate, or that antibiotics were discontinued. It also doesn\\'t directly state that the patient was not discharged on antibiotics. However, the \\'Medications\\' section and \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge\\' do not list antibiotics among the medications at discharge. The closest relevant information is found under \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\' and various problem based summaries, but none directly address antibiotic use or discontinuation. Therefore, the specific fact about empiric antibiotics and discharge status regarding antibiotics is not explicitly mentioned in the provided summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) Reviewed \\'Medications\\' section only mentions continuation of metoprolol/aspirin and discontinuation of clopidogrel. No antibiotics listed in discharge medications. 2) Checked \\'Therapeutic Procedures\\' no mention of antibiotic administration. 3) Examined \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\' WBC and lactate values not reported. 4) In Problem #1 (gallbladder enteric fistula), status is \\'stable...without active infection\\' but no explicit statement about antibiotic initiation/cessation. 5) The summary contains multiple references to infection related concerns (admission for infectious workup, IR drainage history) but never explicitly states antibiotics were started then stopped due to normal WBC/lactate. While clinical context might suggest antibiotic consideration, the specific fact chain (empiric start → normal labs → discontinuation → no discharge antibiotics) isn\\'t explicitly documented in either format of the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 12, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was discharged on TPN with instructions to follow up in 4 weeks  \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the summary step by step: 1. The summary mentions TPN multiple times throughout, confirming the patient is being discharged on TPN: \\'Cyclic TPN optimization with lipid restriction\\' in therapeutic procedures \\'Cyclic TPN (33 kcal/kg)\\' in discharge plans \\'Long term TPN dependence\\' listed as an outstanding issue 2. However, regarding follow up timing: The summary does not explicitly state a 4 week follow up instruction While various follow up plans are mentioned (e.g., \\'surgical/IR follow up\\', \\'biweekly electrolyte monitoring\\'), none specify a 4 week timeframe 3. Therefore, while the TPN at discharge is clearly documented, the specific instruction for 4 week follow up is not mentioned in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s condition at discharge and the discharge plan. Under \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge\\', it is mentioned that the patient was \\'Discharged home with: HealthFlex HHC services, 24/7 family caregiving, Colostomy/wound care supplies\\'. Additionally, in the \\'Problem Based Summary\\' section, specifically under \\'Problem #3: Failure to thrive\\', it states that the discharge plan includes \\'Cyclic TPN (33 kcal/kg)\\'. Although the summary does not explicitly state \\'He was discharged on TPN with instructions to follow up in 4 weeks\\', it does confirm that the patient was discharged on TPN. However, it does not mention the specific follow up timeframe of 4 weeks. The closest relevant information is under \\'Problem #2: Enterocutaneous fistula\\', which mentions \\'Biweekly electrolyte monitoring\\', implying follow up but not exactly at 4 weeks. Thus, while discharge on TPN is confirmed, the specific follow up instruction at 4 weeks is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1) The \\'Medications\\' section explicitly states \\'Cyclic TPN... via Soleo Health\\' under discharge medications. 2) The \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge\\' section confirms \\'Tolerating clear liquids with continued TPN\\' and lists TPN under discharge items. 3) The specific instruction to \\'follow up in 4 weeks\\' is not found in either format. While multiple follow up plans are mentioned (e.g., \\'surgical/IR follow up\\', \\'biweekly electrolyte monitoring\\'), no timeframe of 4 weeks is explicitly stated for any follow up activity. The TPN component is clearly documented, but the 4 week follow up instruction—a critical temporal component of the target fact—is absent from all sections of the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Bilateral mastectomy admission: Explicitly stated in \\'Reason for Admission\\' and \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' sections. 2. Unremarkable postoperative course: Not mentioned. The summary documents multiple postoperative issues (hypertensive urgency, hyperglycemia, lidocaine level fluctuations, skin injury), indicating a clinically notable course. 3. Discharge home: While outpatient follow up plans imply discharge to home, the phrase \\'discharge home\\' is not explicitly stated. The combination of these findings shows two key elements of the fact (admission reason and discharge disposition) are either implied but not fully explicit (discharge) or contradicted (postoperative course). Per guidelines requiring explicit mention of all components, the fact as a whole is not fully stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 13, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt has significant mental health history including anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder and did have a panic attack while admitted \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The summary does mention significant mental health history including anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, and borderline personality disorder in multiple places: 1. Under \\'Relevant Medical History\\' it explicitly lists \\'Bipolar disorder, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, anxiety\\' 2. Under \\'Problem #6: Mental Health Comorbidities\\' these conditions are referenced as being stable on psychotropic medications 3. The medications section lists psychotropic medications including \\'buspirone, quetiapine, trazodone\\' However, while the mental health conditions are clearly documented, there is no explicit mention of the patient having a panic attack during the admission. The mental health status is described as \\'stable on existing psychotropic regimen\\' without any mention of acute anxiety episodes or panic attacks during the hospital stay.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides a detailed account of the patient\\'s admission and treatment. Under \\'Relevant Medical History\\', it is explicitly mentioned that the patient has a history of bipolar disorder, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, and anxiety. Furthermore, under \\'Problem #6: Mental Health Comorbidities\\', it is stated that the patient is stable on existing psychotropic medications, indicating that their mental health conditions were being managed during the hospital stay. However, the summary does not explicitly mention that the patient had a panic attack during admission. The presence of mental health history is confirmed, but the specific fact about having a panic attack is not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** Step 1: Check \\'Relevant Medical History\\' section explicitly lists bipolar disorder, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, and anxiety. Step 2: Search entire document for \\'panic attack\\' not found in admission reason, key investigations, therapeutic procedures, medications, discharge condition, or problem based summary. Step 3: While all chronic mental health diagnoses are clearly documented, there is no mention of an acute panic attack occurring during this admission. The \\'Mental Health Comorbidities\\' problem states \\'stable on existing regimen\\' without reference to acute events. Step 4: Since the panic attack component of the fact is absent despite complete documentation of chronic conditions, the full fact as stated is not explicitly present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I can identify that the patient\\'s DM2 was actually worsened perioperatively, contrary to the fact we\\'re looking for. Specifically: 1. The summary lists \\'Type 2 diabetes mellitus with postoperative hyperglycemia (glucose 157 231 mg/dL)\\' as a secondary diagnosis 2. The patient required moderate sliding scale insulin for blood glucose >200 mg/dL 3. Problem #3 in the problem based summary explicitly notes hyperglycemia requiring management with sliding scale insulin 4. Discharge glucose values remained elevated at 164 231 mg/dL Therefore, since the summary shows clear evidence of perioperative worsening of DM2 (requiring additional insulin and showing consistently elevated glucose levels), the stated fact that DM2 was not worsened is explicitly contradicted by the documentation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s medical history, surgical procedures, and postoperative management. Under \\'Relevant Medical History\\', it is noted that the patient has type 2 diabetes (DM2) with an HbA1c of 7.4%. The \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\' section mentions \\'Type 2 diabetes mellitus with postoperative hyperglycemia\\' and indicates that glucose levels were managed with sliding scale insulin. The \\'Problem Based Summary\\' under \\'Problem #3: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus\\' states that hyperglycemia was managed with moderate sliding scale insulin and plans to resume metformin upon discharge. There is no explicit mention that the patient\\'s chronic medical conditions, including DM2, were not worsened perioperatively. However, the summary indicates that DM2 was managed postoperatively without mentioning any worsening of the condition. The HbA1c was 7.4% before the surgery, and while glucose levels were elevated postoperatively, they were managed with insulin. The fact that there is no explicit statement that DM2 was not worsened perioperatively means we cannot confirm it is mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions postoperative hyperglycemia (glucose 157 231 mg/dL) requiring sliding scale insulin under \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\' and in the conclusion. However, there is no statement indicating whether this represented a worsening of her baseline DM2 versus expected perioperative glucose fluctuations. While hyperglycemia is documented, the summary does not explicitly address whether her chronic DM2 was worsened perioperatively. Other chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension) are noted to have stabilized. The absence of any direct statement about DM2 stability meets the criteria for 0 as per guidelines the fact (or equivalent phrasing) is not present, even though related clinical findings are documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing both the standard section based summary and problem based summary formats, viral gastroenteritis is not explicitly mentioned as the principal diagnosis at discharge. The primary diagnosis is clearly stated in section 4 as \\'Acute kidney injury secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypovolemic insult.\\' While the patient had symptoms that could be consistent with gastroenteritis (nausea/vomiting mentioned in the reason for admission), and these symptoms contributed to the hypovolemia, the discharge diagnosis is never specifically stated as viral gastroenteritis. The conclusion section reiterates that the patient was hospitalized for \\'AKI secondary to hypovolemia.\\' No viral etiology is confirmed or listed as a final diagnosis anywhere in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, treatment, and discharge. The primary diagnosis at discharge is listed under \\'Primary Diagnosis\\' as acute kidney injury secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypovolemic insult. The summary does not explicitly mention \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' as a diagnosis or a condition related to the patient\\'s hospital stay. The patient\\'s symptoms included nausea/vomiting, which could be related to various conditions, but viral gastroenteritis is not directly stated. Therefore, the fact \\'Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis\\' is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states the primary diagnosis as \\'Acute kidney injury secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypovolemic insult\\' and attributes hypovolemia to nausea/vomiting. However, the text does not mention \\'viral gastroenteritis\\' (or equivalent terms like \\'viral enteritis,\\' \\'stomach flu,\\' or specific viral pathogens) as the cause of the nausea/vomiting or as a diagnosis. While nausea/vomiting is documented, the etiology of these symptoms is not specified. The conclusion section also focuses on AKI/ATN resolution without referencing gastroenteritis. Pending viral studies (CMV/BK) relate to transplant monitoring, not enteric pathogens. Therefore, viral gastroenteritis is not explicitly stated as a principal diagnosis at discharge.\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 15, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily stopped when the patient initially came to the hospital.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention that immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily stopped upon admission. In fact, the summary indicates the opposite: 1. Under \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed,\\' it states \\'Immunosuppression management (tacrolimus continued at 1.5 mg daily)\\' 2. Under \\'Medications,\\' it lists \\'Continued: Tacrolimus 1.5 mg daily\\' 3. While some medications were explicitly listed as discontinued (Entresto, IV Zosyn), there is no mention of stopping immunosuppressants 4. The summary shows active management of immunosuppression without interruption Therefore, this specific fact is not mentioned in the hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient was on \\'chronic immunosuppression therapy\\' and lists tacrolimus among the continued medications. However, it does not explicitly state that tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone were temporarily stopped upon admission. In fact, it mentions that \\'tacrolimus continued at 1.5 mg daily,\\' indicating that tacrolimus was not stopped. The summary does not mention mycophenolate or prednisone being discontinued or stopped temporarily. Therefore, the specific fact that immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily stopped is not explicitly mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' section (Section 7) which states \\'Immunosuppression management (tacrolimus continued at 1.5 mg daily)\\'. 2. Checked \\'Medications\\' section (Section 8) which lists tacrolimus as continued, with no mention of mycophenolate or prednisone. 3. Scanned entire document for terms \\'stopped\\', \\'held\\', or \\'discontinued\\' in relation to immunosuppressants only Entresto and Zosyn are mentioned as discontinued. 4. No evidence of temporary cessation of tacrolimus, mycophenolate, or prednisone. The summary explicitly states tacrolimus was continued, and other immunosuppressants are not mentioned at all. 5. Conclusion: The fact about temporary cessation of all three medications is not present in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 16, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Currently on high dose dexamethasone and Bactrim for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly lists \\'IV dexamethasone 4mg BID\\' under Medications and \\'PJP prophylaxis with Bactrim DS\\' in the discharge plan. While the term \\'high dose\\' is not explicitly used for dexamethasone, the specified dose (4mg BID) and clinical context (brain metastases management) are provided. However, since the phrase \\'high dose\\' is absent and 4mg BID is not universally recognized as a high dose (typically 16mg/day is considered high for cerebral edema), the exact wording of the fact is not fully met. Bactrim for PJP prophylaxis is clearly stated. The absence of explicit \\'high dose\\' qualifier for dexamethasone leads to the conclusion that the complete fact is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 17, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, coupled with ketosis secondary to probable starvation and alcohol use\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions hypokalemia (K+ nadir 2.6 mEq/L) and ketosis secondary to starvation/alcohol use in the \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\' and \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\' sections. However, hypomagnesemia is not explicitly stated as a diagnosis or problem. While magnesium supplementation is included in the discharge plan, the summary specifies that Mg²⁺ was 1.8 mg/dL (within normal range) at discharge, and no prior hypomagnesemia is documented. The fact requires both hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, but only hypokalemia with ketosis is clearly mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, while fever is mentioned (Tmax 39.4°C) and there is mention of bibasilar atelectasis on CXR, the summary does not describe a persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative workups. In fact, the summary specifically notes: 1. The patient became \\'afebrile for 72 hours\\' prior to discharge 2. The fever was attributed to \\'tumor fever vs. methotrexate effect\\' 3. Infectious workup was negative (blood/CSF cultures negative, procalcitonin 0.09 ng/mL) 4. While there was bibasilar atelectasis on CXR, this was not described as a suspected infection 5. Empiric antibiotics were discontinued after 72 hours, suggesting no ongoing concern for infection Therefore, while fever and pulmonary findings were present, the specific scenario of persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative workups is not described in this case.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s admission for fever meeting SIRS criteria in the context of high grade B cell lymphoma with CNS progression. The summary indicates that blood and CSF cultures were negative, and the patient was initially treated with empiric antibiotics which were discontinued after 72 hours due to negative cultures. The primary diagnosis was non neutropenic fever secondary to tumor fever vs. methotrexate effect. The summary also mentions that the patient became afebrile for 72 hours before discharge. However, upon closer inspection, it is clear that the initial presentation included fever (Tmax 39.4°C) and that there was a suspicion of infection (as evidenced by the use of empiric antibiotics), but the cultures were negative. The summary does not explicitly mention \\'suspected pulmonary infection.\\' It does mention \\'bibasilar atelectasis\\' on CXR, which could be related to a pulmonary issue but does not directly indicate a suspected pulmonary infection. The fact of \\'persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\' is not explicitly mentioned because the fever was resolved, and there\\'s no clear indication of a suspected pulmonary infection.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions fever meeting SIRS criteria with negative infectious workups (blood/CSF cultures, procalcitonin 0.09 ng/mL) and attributes the fever to tumor fever vs. methotrexate effect. However, there is no mention of suspected pulmonary infection in the context of persistent fever. While bibasilar atelectasis is noted on CXR, this is not equivalent to a suspected pulmonary infection. The negative infectious workups are documented, but the specific suspicion of a pulmonary source is absent from both the primary diagnosis and problem based summaries.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 19, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hydronephrosis is complicated by urinary tract infections (ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus faecalis).\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly lists \\'chronic bilateral hydronephrosis\\' in the patient\\'s medical history and secondary diagnoses. It also documents recurrent UTIs with ESBL E. coli and Klebsiella spp. in the medical history, and the current UTI with Enterococcus faecalis in the primary diagnosis. However, the summary does not explicitly state that hydronephrosis is \\'complicated by\\' these UTIs. While both conditions are present, the causal or complicating relationship between hydronephrosis and the specified pathogens is not articulated in the text. The organisms and hydronephrosis are documented as coexisting conditions rather than one directly complicating the other.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 20, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** HHT with new PE/DVT s/p IVC filter placement as well as changed to fondaparinux\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'HHT with new PE/DVT s/p IVC filter placement as well as changed to fondaparinux\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. Breaking down the fact: 1. \\'HHT\\' is mentioned multiple times in the summary. 2. \\'new PE/DVT\\' The summary indicates the patient had recurrent thromboembolic disease (DVT/PE). 3. \\'s/p IVC filter placement\\' The summary confirms IVC filter placement on 05/10/2023. 4. \\'changed to fondaparinux\\' The summary states that fondaparinux was discontinued and switched to apixaban, indicating the patient was on fondaparinux prior to the switch. However, it does not state the patient was \\'changed to fondaparinux\\'; rather, it indicates fondaparinux was discontinued. Thus, the fact as stated is not entirely accurate. The correct sequence is that the patient was on fondaparinux, then switched to apixaban. Despite this nuance, the key elements (HHT, new PE/DVT, IVC filter placement, and the mention of fondaparinux) are present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. HHT is explicitly mentioned in both the medical history and secondary diagnoses. 2. New PE/DVT is documented in the reason for admission and imaging findings. 3. IVC filter placement (05/10/2023) is clearly stated in surgical history and therapeutic procedures. 4. The summary explicitly states \\'Fondaparinux (switched to apixaban)\\' under medications, indicating a change FROM fondaparinux TO apixaban. Since the fact specifies \\'changed TO fondaparinux\\' (impaction initiation), but the text describes discontinuation of fondaparinux, this specific directional change is not mentioned. The fact\\'s exact medication transition direction is absent.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions that the patient was initiated on prednisone 100 mg daily for thrombocytopenia, and there is an improvement in platelet count from 42 to 82. The summary under \\'Problem #2: Thrombocytopenia\\' states that the patient was on \\'high dose steroids\\' and that the plan was to \\'continue prednisone 100 mg daily.\\' This indicates that prednisone was started during the hospital stay and was continued at discharge. The phrase \\'worsening thrombocytopenia\\' is not directly used, but the summary mentions \\'progressive thrombocytopenia\\' as a reason for admission and notes improvement after prednisone initiation. Thus, the fact of \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\' is partially mentioned in the context of improvement post initiation of prednisone, though \\'taper\\' is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Worsening Thrombocytopenia : The summary explicitly mentions \\'progressive thrombocytopenia\\' in the Reason for Admission, which is a direct clinical equivalent of \\'worsening thrombocytopenia.\\' 2. s/p Prednisone Taper Initiation : While prednisone 100 mg daily was initiated (as stated in Medications), the summary does not explicitly mention a taper (i.e., planned dose reduction). The discharge plan specifies \\'continue prednisone 100 mg daily\\' without referencing a tapering schedule. Since \\'taper initiation\\' implies an active reduction process, this detail is absent. The fact requires both components; while worsening thrombocytopenia is present, the prednisone taper initiation is not explicitly documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 20, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing both formats of the hospital course summary, I found that while CBC monitoring is mentioned, it specifies only \\'monitor CBC weekly\\' under Problem #2: Thrombocytopenia in the discharge plan and goals section. The summary does not explicitly state that CBCs were ordered twice weekly after discharge. The frequency mentioned (weekly) is different from the fact we\\'re looking for (twice weekly).\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was analyzed for the fact \\'Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\'. The relevant section to check for this information is \\'Problem #2: Thrombocytopenia\\' under the Problem Based Summary. It states \\'monitor CBC weekly\\', which implies once weekly CBC monitoring, not twice weekly. Therefore, the specific fact of ordering \\'twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\' is not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions monitoring CBC weekly in the discharge plan for Problem #2 (Thrombocytopenia) under \\'Discharge Plan and Goals\\'. However, the specific instruction for \\'twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\' is not found anywhere in the text. The documented frequency is weekly, not twice weekly. While CBC monitoring is mentioned, the required frequency (twice weekly) is absent, and no equivalent phrasing or abbreviation for this frequency exists in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 21, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** recurrent falls of unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After analyzing the hospital course summary, I find that while recurrent falls are mentioned multiple times, there is no explicit statement about them being of unknown etiology despite extensive workup. Let\\'s break down the evidence: 1. Falls are mentioned in several places: As part of admission reason In primary diagnosis related to T6 fracture As Problem #2 \\'Recurrent Falls/Gait Instability\\' 2. However, the summary actually provides several potential contributing factors to the falls: Gait instability (AM PAC 11/24) NSVT episodes associated with MAP drops Possible medication effects (gabapentin was discontinued due to sedation/fall risk) 3. There is no mention of an \\'extensive workup\\' specifically for fall etiology being inconclusive or the falls being of unknown cause. 4. In fact, the summary suggests that some causes were identified and addressed through interventions like medication adjustments and PT/OT planning.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions \\'recurrent falls\\' in multiple sections (Reason for Admission, Primary Diagnosis, Secondary Diagnoses, and Problem #2). However, the phrase \\'unknown etiology despite extensive workup inpatient\\' is not directly stated. While the summary notes diagnostic investigations (e.g., telemetry, troponin, CT spine) and unresolved issues like \\'undetermined correlation between NSVT and hypotension,\\' it does not explicitly state that the etiology of falls remains unknown after an extensive inpatient evaluation. The workup details are listed, but the conclusion that the etiology is unknown is not articulated in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, there is no explicit mention that the T6 wedge compression fracture occurred before the most recent fall. While the fracture is described as \\'subacute\\' in the Primary Diagnosis section and is noted as a \\'New T6 wedge compression fracture\\' in the diagnostic investigations section (dated 03/14/2023), the temporal relationship to the patient\\'s falls is not clearly established. The summary mentions \\'recurrent falls\\' multiple times but does not specify when the fracture occurred in relation to these falls. Without an explicit statement about the timing of the fracture relative to the falls, we cannot definitively say this fact is mentioned in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions a T6 wedge compression fracture in multiple sections. Under \\'Primary Diagnosis\\', it is stated as \\'Subacute T6 wedge compression fracture secondary to recurrent falls.\\' The \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\' section confirms this with a CT spine result showing a \\'New T6 wedge compression fracture\\' on 03/14/2023. Additionally, the \\'Problem Based Summary\\' under \\'Problem #1: T6 Compression Fracture\\' further emphasizes the presence of this condition. However, the summary does not explicitly state that the T6 wedge compression fracture \\'likely happened before most recent fall.\\' The closest information related to the timing is found under \\'Primary Diagnosis\\' where it is described as \\'secondary to recurrent falls,\\' which implies the fracture is related to falls but does not specify if it happened before or after the most recent fall. Thus, while the presence of a T6 wedge compression fracture is explicitly mentioned, the specific detail about it likely happening before the most recent fall is not directly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 22, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states that the patient developed cholangitis following an IR biliary drain exchange (12/25/2022), with the primary diagnosis being \\'acute cholangitis secondary to biliary drain malfunction.\\' While the fact specifies \\'stent exchange\\' and the summary refers to \\'drain exchange,\\' these terms are not clinically synonymous. A biliary drain (external catheter) and a stent (internal device) are distinct interventions. Since the summary does not mention a stent exchange or use terminology that a physician would consider equivalent to \\'stent,\\' the specific fact about post procedural cholangitis following a biliary stent exchange is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I carefully reviewed both Format 1 and Format 2 of the hospital course summary looking for any mention of Augmentin therapy or its re evaluation prior to 14 day completion. While the summary does mention antibiotic therapy, specifically noting piperacillin/tazobactam and a 14 day antibiotic course (in Problem #3 of Format 2), there is no explicit mention of Augmentin or any planned re evaluation of Augmentin therapy. The only antibiotics specifically mentioned are piperacillin/tazobactam in both the Medications section of Format 1 and the treatment description in Format 2. The fact about continuing and re evaluating Augmentin therapy is not present in either format of the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'should continue and re eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, it is noted that the patient was treated with piperacillin/tazobactam for bacteremia and cholangitis, not Augmentin. The summary does mention completing a 14 day antibiotic course under \\'Problem #3: Bacteremia (E. coli)\\' in the Problem Based Summary section. Although Augmentin is not mentioned, piperacillin/tazobactam is the antibiotic used, and the summary indicates a plan to complete a 14 day course. The specific fact about Augmentin is not present, but the concept of continuing and evaluating the antibiotic course is relevant to the treatment plan described.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states under Problem #3 (Bacteremia) that the plan was to \\'Complete 14 day antibiotic course\\' with piperacillin/tazobactam. However, there is no mention of Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate) anywhere in the document. The antibiotic therapy discussed is piperacillin/tazobactam, and while the 14 day completion is noted, there is no reference to re evaluating continuation of Augmentin specifically before completing the course. Since Augmentin therapy is not mentioned at all in any section (including medications started/continued/discontinued), the specific fact about Augmentin continuation/re evaluation cannot be considered present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 22, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** patient should follow up with Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/ Physician Assistant) in 1 week and Poultsides, George, MD in in 2 weeks\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing both Format 1 and Format 2 of the hospital course summary, I do not find any explicit mention of follow up appointments with either an Advanced Practice Provider in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides, George, MD in 2 weeks. While the summary does mention some follow up plans (such as IR follow up for drain maintenance and nutrition follow up with outpatient Cancer Center dietitian), these specific appointments with the mentioned providers and their timing are not documented in the summary. The discharge planning sections in both formats do not contain this information. Even when checking related sections like \\'Outstanding Issues\\' and \\'Discharge Plan\\' under each problem, these particular follow up appointments are not mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was thoroughly reviewed to determine if the specific follow up instructions for the patient were mentioned. The summary includes various sections detailing the patient\\'s hospital course, diagnoses, treatments, and discharge plans. However, upon careful examination, there is no explicit mention of a follow up appointment with an Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant) in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides, George, MD in 2 weeks in any of the sections, including \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge\\' and \\'Discharge Plan\\' under the problem based summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary was reviewed in both standard and problem based formats. While follow up plans with a dietitian and IR (Interventional Radiology) are mentioned, there is no explicit reference to follow up appointments with an Advanced Practice Provider (Nurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant) in 1 week or with Dr. Poultsides in 2 weeks. The text specifies \\'Nutrition follow up arranged with outpatient Cancer Center dietitian\\' and \\'IR follow up for drain maintenance\\' but does not include the named providers or the stated timelines. Since neither the specific providers nor the 1 week/2 week intervals are documented, the fact is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 23, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing both Format 1 and Format 2 of the hospital course summary, the specific fact about Cardiology coordinating follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR and a new clinical trial drug in 4/2023 is not explicitly mentioned. While the summary does mention: 1. The patient has severe bioprosthetic mitral valve stenosis 2. There is a need for cardiology follow up (mentioned in Problem #2: \\'cardiology follow up (TTE pending)\\') 3. There is mention of a clinical trial, but it\\'s for epocritamab (hematology related) in April 2023, not a heart failure trial 4. The summary notes \\'persistent MV gradient elevation requiring reassessment\\' However, there is no specific mention of coordinating with the Heart Failure team, discussing transcatheter MVR, or a new clinical trial drug related to cardiac issues.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Cardiology will help coordinate close follow up with the Heart Failure team to discuss transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. Upon reviewing the summary, it is noted that under \\'Problem #2: Valvular stenosis related volume overload\\', the discharge plan includes \\'cardiology follow up (TTE pending)\\'. Additionally, in the \\'Conclusion\\' section, it is mentioned that \\'coordinated discharge plans prioritize... cardiology follow ups for valvular reassessment and CLL trial enrollment.\\' While there is mention of cardiology follow up and a CLL trial enrollment in April 2023 under \\'Problem #1\\' and in the \\'Conclusion\\', the specific details about discussing \\'transcatheter MVR iso likely new clinical trial drug 4/2023\\' are not explicitly stated. The summary does not directly mention \\'transcatheter MVR\\' or a \\'new clinical trial drug\\', making the fact not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The analysis proceeds as follows: 1. The specific fact requires confirmation of cardiology coordinating follow up with Heart Failure team regarding transcatheter MVR and a clinical trial drug in April 2023. 2. In the \\'Discharge Plan\\' for Problem #2 (valvular stenosis), cardiology follow up is mentioned for TTE pending, but no reference to Heart Failure team coordination or transcatheter MVR. 3. The \\'Pending Issues\\' in Problem #1 mention \\'epocritamab trial enrollment (April 2023)\\', but this is a hematology trial (CLL related), not cardiac. 4. The conclusion references \\'cardiology follow ups for valvular reassessment and CLL trial enrollment\\', but again no explicit mention of Failure team involvement or transcatheter MVR planning. While cardiology follow up and a 4/2023 trial are present, the specific elements (Heart Failure team coordination, transcatheter MVR) are absent.\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 24, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** I analyzed the summary for explicit mention of discharge diet status and pain medications. In the \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge\\' section, it mentions \\'tolerance of full liquids.\\' However, while the summary discusses pain management (noting \\'effective non opioid pain control\\' and that narcotics were avoided), it does not explicitly state that the patient was discharged on oral pain medications. Since both components of the fact (full liquid diet AND oral pain medications at discharge) must be present, and only one is clearly mentioned, I must conclude this specific fact is not fully documented in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** Step 1: Search for \\'full liquid diet\\' Found in \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge\\' section: \\'tolerance of full liquids\\'. \\'Full liquids\\' is a standard clinical synonym for full liquid diet. Step 2: Search for \\'oral pain medications\\' Medications section states \\'Avoided: Narcotics (effective non opioid pain control)\\' but does not specify any oral pain medications being prescribed at discharge. While non opioid control is mentioned, this does not equate to explicit documentation of oral pain medications being part of discharge regimen. Step 3: The conjunction \\'and\\' in the target phrase requires both elements. While the diet component is clearly present, the pain medication component lacks explicit documentation of being oral or discharge medications.\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 25, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Analyzing the summary step by step: 1. The summary mentions an Upper GI contrast study on 01/13/2024 that showed \\'no evidence of mechanical obstruction\\', which partially aligns with the target fact. 2. The summary indicates the patient received PPI therapy (pantoprazole) and famotidine (H2 blocker), which matches part of the medication management in the target fact. 3. However, the summary does not explicitly mention: Discussion with general GI and advanced GI Their deferral of EGD/ERCP The specific recommendation for 8 weeks of empiric PPI Plans for possible ERCP in the following weeks While there is some overlap in the basic findings and treatment approach, several specific details from the target fact are missing from the hospital course summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The task is to determine if the fact \\'Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\' is explicitly mentioned in the hospital course summary. The summary is analyzed in two formats: Standard Section Based Summary and Problem Based Summary. In the Standard Section Based Summary, under \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results,\\' it is mentioned that an \\'Upper GI contrast study (01/13/2024): No evidence of mechanical obstruction.\\' This statement is similar to \\'Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum.\\' Although the exact wording is not used, the clinical implication is the same. The summary also mentions that the patient was started on pantoprazole (PPI) and initially was on famotidine, which aligns with being started on IV famotidine and later switching to PPI. The discussion with GI specialists and the plan for empiric PPI is reflected in the Problem Based Summary under \\'Problem #2: Duodenitis/Gastric Distention,\\' where it is stated that symptoms improved with NG decompression/PPI, and pantoprazole was continued at discharge. However, the specific details about deferring EGD/ERCP and recommending empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient ERCP evaluation are not explicitly mentioned in the provided summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Upper GI series: The summary explicitly states \\'Upper GI contrast study (01/13/2024): No evidence of mechanical obstruction,\\' which matches the first part of the fact. 2. Famotidine/PPI use: The summary describes discontinuation of PPI (12/31/2023) due to allergy, replacement with oral famotidine, and eventual restart of pantoprazole at discharge. However, IV famotidine and BID PPI dosing are not mentioned. 3. GI consultation details: While GI follow up is planned, there is no explicit mention of discussions with general/advanced GI teams, deferral of EGD/ERCP, or the 8 week PPI duration. The absence of these specific elements means the full fact is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**34. Patient 25, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing both the standard section based summary and problem based summary sections, there is no explicit mention of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) on admission or its treatment with fluids. The summary details various medical issues including malignant ascites, portal vein thrombosis, duodenitis, rhinovirus infection, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but does not mention any kidney problems. The therapeutic interventions described focus on paracentesis, anticoagulation management, and treatment of duodenitis. While fluid management may have occurred during the hospitalization, there is no specific mention of AKI or its resolution with fluid therapy.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly mention \\'AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved.\\' To determine this, I reviewed the provided summary, checking sections such as \\'Reason for Admission,\\' \\'Relevant Medical History,\\' \\'Primary Diagnosis,\\' \\'Secondary Diagnoses,\\' \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results,\\' \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed,\\' and \\'Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge.\\' None of these sections directly mention acute kidney injury (AKI), its treatment with fluids, or its resolution. Additionally, the \\'Problem Based Summary\\' section lists several problems but does not include AKI. Therefore, based on the information provided, the fact \\'AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved\\' is not explicitly mentioned.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Scanned entire hospital course summary for mentions of AKI (acute kidney injury) or equivalent terms (e.g., \\'acute renal failure\\', \\'creatinine elevation\\'). No relevant terms found in any section (Relevant Medical History, Primary/Secondary Diagnoses, Key Investigations, Medications, or Problem Based Summary). 2. Checked therapeutic interventions: Fluids are not mentioned in the \\'Medications\\' section (only enoxaparin, PPIs, etc.) or \\'Therapeutic Procedures\\' (paracentesis, anticoagulation). No documentation of IV fluids administration or fluid resuscitation. 3. Reviewed discharge condition: While \\'resolved neutropenia\\' is noted, there is no mention of renal function normalization or AKI resolution. 4. AKI management/response is absent from both problem lists and conclusion. The summary focuses on ascites, thrombosis, and cancer management without renal complications.\\n\\n\\n\\n**35. Patient 26, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Metoprolol dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily for improved rate control; Apixaban dosage increased to 5 mg twice daily for anticoagulation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I found that while the medication adjustments mentioned are similar, they don\\'t exactly match the specific fact we\\'re looking for. The summary indicates: 1. Metoprolol was increased to 37.5 mg q6h (which equals 150 mg daily total, not 75 mg twice daily) 2. Apixaban was \\'reinstated\\' at 5 mg BID (not increased to this dose) While both medications are present in the summary and were adjusted, the specific dosing changes mentioned in the fact (metoprolol 75 mg BID and an increase in apixaban to 5 mg BID) are not explicitly stated in this way. The actual adjustments described in the summary are different for metoprolol and don\\'t indicate a dose increase for apixaban.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s treatment and medication adjustments during their hospital stay. To determine if the specific fact about Metoprolol and Apixaban dosage is mentioned, we need to look for relevant sections in the summary. The \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' section mentions \\'Metoprolol intensification (50 → 150 mg daily via q6h tartrate dosing)\\', which indicates a change in Metoprolol dosage. The \\'Medications\\' section further details that Metoprolol tartrate was given at 37.5 mg q6h, which translates to 150 mg daily. This matches the intensification mentioned earlier. For Apixaban, the \\'Medications\\' section states it was \\'Reinstated: Apixaban 5 mg BID\\', indicating the dosage was 5 mg twice daily. The fact states that Metoprolol dosage was increased to 75 mg twice daily and Apixaban to 5 mg twice daily. While the total daily dose of Metoprolol was increased to 150 mg, it was administered as 37.5 mg q6h, not 75 mg twice daily. However, the total daily dose matches the expected increase. Apixaban\\'s dosage is correctly stated as 5 mg BID. Thus, the fact is partially incorrect regarding Metoprolol dosing frequency but correct in total daily dose and Apixaban dosage.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Metoprolol analysis: The summary states \\'Metoprolol tartrate 37.5 mg q6h\\' (every 6 hours) in both the Medications section and Problem #1. This equals 150 mg daily (37.5 mg x 4 doses), but the 75 mg BID (twice daily) regimen specified in the fact is not mentioned. While the total daily dose matches, the frequency differs significantly (q6h vs BID), and no explicit mention of a dose increase to 75 mg BID exists. 2. Apixaban analysis: The summary states \\'Apixaban 5 mg BID\\' was reinstated. While this matches the target dose in the fact, there is no mention of a dosage increase (only reinstatement at this dose). The fact requires confirmation that the dose was increased to 5 mg BID, which isn\\'t explicitly documented here. Conclusion: Neither the specific metoprolol dosing schedule nor an explicit apixaban dose increase is stated. The total metoprolol dose matches but administration frequency is different, and apixaban documentation lacks evidence of a dose escalation.\\n\\n\\n\\n**36. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After analyzing the hospital course summary, while SMA stenosis is mentioned multiple times, there is no explicit connection made between the patient\\'s emesis and chronic mesenteric ischemia. The summary mentions \\'Moderate superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis\\' under Secondary Diagnoses and discusses it as Problem #4, but attributes the patient\\'s nausea and vomiting to acute gastritis/dyspepsia. The summary indicates that gastrointestinal symptoms resolved with IV fluids and antiemetics, suggesting a different etiology. While SMA stenosis is noted to be monitored for chronic mesenteric ischemia symptoms in the future, there is no explicit statement linking the current episode of emesis to mesenteric ischemia. The fact requires both the connection between emesis and chronic mesenteric ischemia AND the CT finding of SMA stenosis while the latter is present, the former connection is not explicitly made.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary mentions that the patient had moderate superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis as revealed by CT angiography under \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results\\'. It also lists \\'SMA Stenosis\\' as \\'Problem #4\\' in the Problem Based Summary, indicating that the condition was monitored and there was a plan to refer to vascular surgery if the patient became symptomatic for chronic mesenteric ischemia. However, the summary does not explicitly state that the patient\\'s emesis is related to chronic mesenteric ischemia. It does mention that gastrointestinal symptoms resolved with antiemetics and dietary modifications, and under \\'Problem #4: SMA Stenosis\\', it notes the patient was asymptomatic after volume repletion. The direct linkage between emesis and SMA stenosis is not made in the provided text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly lists \\'moderate superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis\\' as a secondary diagnosis and notes CT angiography confirmed this finding. Under Problem #4 (SMA Stenosis), the discharge plan includes monitoring for chronic mesenteric ischemia symptoms. However, the summary attributes the patient\\'s emesis to acute gastritis/dyspepsia (Problem #2) and hypovolemia (primary diagnosis), with no direct statement linking vomiting to SMA stenosis or chronic mesenteric ischemia. While SMA stenosis and its potential clinical implications are documented, the causal relationship between emesis and mesenteric ischemia is not explicitly stated in either format of the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**37. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly states the patient was admitted for neutropenic fever (Reason for Admission) and had coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) bacteremia (Primary Diagnosis). The summary documents PICC removal (Therapeutic Procedures) and antibiotic therapy (vancomycin, linezolid). However, the fact specifies \\'coagulase negative strep,\\' which refers to Streptococcus species, while the summary identifies the pathogen as Staphylococcus (CoNS). These are distinct bacterial genera. Since the summary does not mention Streptococcus bacteremia or any equivalent phrasing, the specific fact as stated is not present.\\n\\n\\n\\n**38. Patient 27, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** TTE on 3/6/23 w/o evidence of mass or vegetations\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed on 3/6/23 under the Key Diagnostic Investigations and Results section. It states: \\'Transthoracic echocardiogram: No vegetations (3/6)\\'. While the absence of vegetations is clearly documented, the summary does not explicitly mention the absence of a \\'mass\\' in the TTE findings. The fact in question requires both \\'no mass\\' and \\'no vegetations\\' to be considered fully addressed. Since only the absence of vegetations is stated, and there is no mention of mass (even as an implied normal finding), the complete fact as specified is not explicitly documented.\\n\\n\\n\\n**39. Patient 27, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** The hospital course summary does mention tonsillar findings and treatment with antibiotics, but not in a way that specifically indicates tonsillitis as the primary diagnosis. Let\\'s break this down: 1. The summary mentions \\'Asymmetric tonsillar enlargement (L > R) without abscess\\' as a secondary diagnosis 2. CT maxillofacial confirms \\'tonsillar enlargement\\' 3. While antibiotics were given (piperacillin tazobactam, cefepime, vancomycin), these were primarily for neutropenic fever and CoNS bacteremia, not specifically for tonsillitis 4. The tonsillar findings appear to be part of a broader clinical picture including dental caries and oropharyngeal thrush, rather than a clear diagnosis of tonsillitis 5. There is no mention of typical tonsillitis symptoms like exudates, severe throat pain, or specific localization of symptoms to the tonsils\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary mentions \\'Asymmetric tonsillar enlargement (L > R) without abscess\\' under Secondary Diagnoses and \\'CT maxillofacial: [...] tonsillar enlargement\\' in imaging. However, it does not explicitly use the term \\'tonsilitis\\' or describe inflammatory/infectious features (e.g., erythema, exudate) to confirm the diagnosis. While antibiotics (vancomycin, linezolid) were administered, they are explicitly tied to CoNS bacteremia management rather than tonsillar pathology. The summary describes structural enlargement but lacks direct evidence of clinical tonsilitis diagnosis or targeted treatment for it.\\n\\n\\n\\n**40. Patient 28, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission and treatment. The \\'Reason for Admission\\' section mentions the patient was admitted for biliary drain optimization following PTBD exchange. The \\'Relevant Surgical History\\' section lists PTBD placement and subsequent exchanges, including one on 04/08/2023. The \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' section confirms sequential PTBD exchanges (14 Fr → 16 Fr). Although the exact date \\'4/21/23\\' is not mentioned, the summary implies that PTBD exchange was a relevant procedure during the hospitalization, and the dates provided (03/25, 04/08) suggest that PTBD exchanges were performed around the mentioned date. The fact \\'Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23\\' is not explicitly mentioned with the exact date, but the clinical context and procedures align with the described condition and treatment.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary explicitly mentions recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia and PTBD exchanges. Under \\'Reason for Admission,\\' it states the patient was admitted for biliary drain optimization following PTBD exchange. The \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' section notes sequential PTBD exchanges (14 Fr → 16 Fr) during this admission. However, the specific date of 4/21/23 for the PTBD exchange is not mentioned anywhere in the summary. While PTBD exchanges are clearly part of the admission reason and treatment, the exact date (4/21/23) is not provided in either the surgical history, therapeutic procedures, or problem based summaries. The date 4/25/23 appears only in the context of discontinuing occupational therapy. Since the fact requires the specific date of the PTBD exchange (4/21/23), which is not explicitly stated, the date component of the fact is missing.\\n\\n\\n\\n**41. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, the specific fact about bilirubin not improving despite PTBD exchange and subsequent transition to hospice is NOT explicitly mentioned. In fact, the summary indicates the opposite: 1. The summary states \\'bilirubin decreased to 10.8 mg/dL\\' from a peak of 17.6 mg/dL, showing improvement. 2. While the patient did transition to home hospice (mentioned in both Format 1 and Format 2), this transition is not described as being due to failed bilirubin improvement. 3. The conclusion section indicates \\'Biliary drainage was optimized through sequential PTBD exchanges (14 Fr → 16 Fr) with subsequent bilirubin reduction.\\' Therefore, while the hospice transition is mentioned, the specific combination of failed bilirubin improvement leading to hospice transition is not present in the text.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, treatment, and discharge plan. The key fact to determine is whether \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice\\' is explicitly mentioned. Upon reviewing the summary, it is noted that the bilirubin level did decrease after PTBD exchange (from 17.6 mg/dL to 10.8 mg/dL), indicating some improvement. The summary also mentions that the patient was transitioned to home hospice. However, the statement \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange\\' is not accurate according to the provided information. The fact that the patient/family opted to transition to home hospice is mentioned. Thus, the specific fact is not entirely accurate as it contains a partial inaccuracy regarding bilirubin improvement.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Reviewed \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\' and \\'Problem #1\\' sections for bilirubin trends. The summary states bilirubin decreased from peak 17.6 mg/dL to 10.8 mg/dL post PTBD exchange, indicating improvement. 2. Checked discharge plans: \\'Transitioned to home hospice\\' is explicitly stated in both the Patient\\'s Condition at Discharge and Problem #5 sections. 3. The critical discrepancy: While hospice transition is confirmed, the summary explicitly documents bilirubin improvement (contradicting the \\'did not improve\\' portion of the fact). Since both elements must be true for the fact as stated, the bilirubin component makes the full fact unmentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n**42. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** Let\\'s analyze the hospital course for each component of the fact: 1. Sepsis requiring antibiotics and fluid resuscitation: While IV fluid resuscitation is explicitly mentioned multiple times (e.g., \\'IV resuscitation\\' in admission reason, \\'Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation\\' in procedures), sepsis and antibiotics are not explicitly mentioned. 2. Delirium requiring pharmacotherapy: Delirium is explicitly mentioned multiple times (listed as secondary diagnosis, has its own problem section) Pharmacotherapy for delirium is mentioned (\\'Lorazepam PRN for agitation\\') 3. Urinary retention requiring catheter: While there are mentions of oliguria and kidney function, there is no explicit mention of urinary retention or catheter placement. While some elements are present (delirium with medication management, fluid resuscitation), key components like sepsis, antibiotics, and urinary catheterization are not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, the complete fact as stated is not fully present in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary details the patient\\'s admission for hyperbilirubinemia, hypotension, dehydration, and delirium. The summary explicitly mentions \\'delirium requiring pharmacotherapy\\' under the \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\' section and \\'Lorazepam PRN for agitation\\' under \\'Medications\\', indicating pharmacotherapy for delirium. \\'Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation\\' is mentioned under \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\', aligning with \\'aggressive fluid resuscitation\\' for sepsis or similar shock states. Although \\'sepsis\\' is not directly stated, the presence of \\'infection management\\' in the \\'Reason for Admission\\' and \\'cholangitis\\' throughout the summary implies a severe infection that could be considered sepsis. \\'Urinary retention requiring urinary catheter\\' is not explicitly mentioned anywhere in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** Step 1: Analyze sepsis component The summary mentions \\'infection management\\' and \\'aggressive IV fluid resuscitation\\' but never explicitly states \\'sepsis\\' (a key term in the fact). While cholangitis (bile duct infection) is present, sepsis requires systemic inflammatory response which is not documented here. Antibiotics are implied in infection management but not explicitly mentioned. Step 2: Delirium component \\'Delirium requiring pharmacotherapy\\' is partially met. Lorazepam PRN for agitation is documented, which qualifies as pharmacotherapy for delirium symptoms. Step 3: Urinary retention component The summary documents oliguria (low urine output) secondary to dehydration but no mention of urinary retention (inability to void) or catheter placement for retention. Oliguria management involved fluids, not catheterization. Conclusion: Only 1/3 components (delirium treatment) is fully addressed. The absence of explicit sepsis documentation and lack of urinary retention/catheterization meets criteria for fact_mentioned=0.\\n\\n\\n\\n**43. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After carefully reviewing the hospital course summary, I can confirm that the fact about deferring cancer management to outpatient oncology per son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium is not explicitly stated. While the summary does mention several related elements: 1. The patient has T4 nasopharyngeal carcinoma with metastases 2. The patient experienced hyperactive delirium (which resolved by discharge) 3. The son is mentioned as the primary caregiver 4. There is a note under \\'Problem #1\\' that states \\'Treatment plan pending mental capacity evaluation\\' 5. There is mention of \\'expedited radiation oncology consultation\\' as part of the discharge plan However, nowhere does it explicitly state that management was deferred to outpatient oncology specifically because of the son\\'s wishes and the patient\\'s delirium. While these elements are present separately, their causal relationship to the deferral of cancer management is not explicitly stated.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary provides detailed information about the patient\\'s admission, diagnosis, treatment, and discharge plan. The key fact to look for is whether the management of the patient\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was deferred to an outpatient oncologist per the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and the patient\\'s delirium. Upon reviewing the summary, it is noted that the patient\\'s T4 nasopharyngeal carcinoma with bilateral cervical nodal metastases is discussed, and there is mention of \\'Expedited radiation oncology consultation\\' under the problem based summary for Problem #1. However, there is no explicit mention that the management was deferred to an outpatient oncologist due to the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and the patient\\'s delirium. The summary does mention the patient\\'s delirium under Secondary Diagnoses as \\'Hyperactive delirium (resolved by discharge)\\' and notes the patient\\'s son was trained as a primary caregiver. Nonetheless, the specific reason for deferring management to an outpatient setting is not clearly stated in the provided summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** The hospital course summary does not explicitly state that management of metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was deferred to an outpatient oncologist due to the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and the patient\\'s delirium. While the summary mentions: 1) \\'Expedited radiation oncology consultation\\' in the discharge plan, 2) \\'Treatment plan pending mental capacity evaluation\\' as an outstanding issue, and 3) the son\\'s role as primary caregiver, there is no direct connection between these elements. The delirium is documented as resolved by discharge, and while family education occurred, there is no explicit documentation of care decisions being deferred specifically to the outpatient oncologist at the family\\'s request. The mental capacity evaluation is mentioned as pending but not directly linked to treatment deferral decisions.\\n\\n\\n\\n**44. Patient 29, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** After reviewing the hospital course summary, I found evidence of aspiration risk and NPO status but not explicit mention of temporary O2 requirement due to aspiration pneumonitis. Here\\'s the step by step analysis: 1. Under \\'Problem #3: Dysphagia/Aspiration Risk\\', the summary mentions: \\'Strict NPO\\' status Need for suctioning due to increased secretions Requirement for aspiration precautions 2. The SLP (Speech Language Pathology) involvement is documented 3. However, while aspiration risk is clearly a concern, there is no explicit mention of: A temporary oxygen requirement Development of aspiration pneumonitis Any respiratory complications requiring oxygen therapy While the patient was at risk for aspiration and was made NPO, the specific fact about developing temporary O2 requirement due to aspiration pneumonitis is not explicitly stated in the summary.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The hospital course summary was thoroughly reviewed to determine if the fact \\'Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP\\' is explicitly mentioned. The summary is divided into sections, including a standard section based summary and a problem based summary. In the \\'Reason for Admission\\' section, the patient is admitted for failure to thrive and dysphagia secondary to nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\' section lists several conditions but does not directly mention aspiration pneumonitis or a temporary O2 requirement. However, under \\'Problem #3: Dysphagia/Aspiration Risk\\' in the problem based summary, it is stated that the patient is on \\'Strict NPO\\' with increased secretions requiring suctioning, indicating a risk of aspiration. Although there is no explicit mention of \\'aspiration pneumonitis\\' or a \\'temporary O2 requirement,\\' the patient\\'s aspiration risk is highlighted, and strict NPO status is confirmed. The fact that the patient was made strict NPO is directly mentioned, aligning with part of the fact in question.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** Step 1: Search for oxygen requirement mentions No references to oxygen supplementation, desaturation events, or respiratory support found in either format. The conclusion and problem lists focus on nutritional/aspiration issues without respiratory complications. Step 2: Check for aspiration pneumonitis diagnosis While \\'aspiration risk\\' is listed in Problem #3, the specific diagnosis of \\'aspiration pneumonitis\\' is never stated. Step 3: Verify SLP directed NPO status The summary explicitly states \\'strict NPO\\' in both formats (Discharge Condition and Problem #3 Current Status) and references SLP involvement in discharge planning, but does NOT explicitly state that SLP ordered/made the patient NPO. The NPO status is presented as an existing condition rather than a new intervention. Step 4: Final determination While components of the fact exist (aspiration risk, NPO status, SLP involvement), neither the temporary oxygen requirement nor the explicit attribution to aspiration pneumonitis/SLP driven NPO decision are present in the text.\\n\\n\\n\\n### B.

All Inconsistent Facts and Explanations\\n\\n**1. Patient 2, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down, and obstructing necrotic mass were removed. Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis was performed\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'adhesions between omentum and abdominal wall were taken down\\' and \\'obstructing necrotic mass removed\\' with small bowel resection. 2. Hospital Summary (Therapeutic Procedures) only documents \\'small bowel resection with primary anastomosis\\' without mentioning adhesiolysis. 3. While \\'necrotic small bowel mass\\' is referenced in diagnoses, the surgical report in the summary lacks explicit documentation of adhesion takedown. 4. These are distinct procedural elements adhesion management is not implied by resection documentation alone. 5. Therefore, the summary omission directly contradicts the fact\\'s specific surgical details.\\n\\n\\n\\n**2. Patient 3, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** LLQ abdominal pain 2/2 cancer\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states LLQ abdominal pain is due to cancer (2/2 cancer). 2. Hospital Summary lists \\'Functional abdominal pain with IBS features\\' under Secondary Diagnoses. 3. \\'Functional\\' pain implies non organic etiology, conflicting with cancer attribution. 4. No other LLQ pain etiology related to cancer is documented in diagnoses or problem lists.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3. Patient 4, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on CKD 2/2 urinary retention treated with foley catheter placement\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states AKI on CKD due to urinary retention treated with Foley. 2. Summary\\'s \\'Secondary Diagnoses\\' lists CKD IV but does not mention AKI. 3. Summary\\'s \\'Key Labs\\' show Cr 3.6 3.8 (explicitly noted as baseline). 4. Problem #4 in problem based summary describes \\'baseline renal function (Cr 3.6 3.8)\\' with no AKI documentation. 5. Foley use is documented for retention management, but renal function remained at baseline without acute deterioration.\\n\\n\\n\\n**4. Patient 6, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Adrenal crisis in a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency secondary to autoimmune ployglandular syndrome likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone. \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states adrenal crisis was \\'likely due to intolerance of PO prednisone\\'. 2. Hospital Summary attributes crisis to \\'gastrointestinal illness\\' as precipitant (Reason for Admission section). 3. Summary shows successful transition to PO prednisone 2.5 mg BID at discharge (Medications/Discharge Plan), indicating tolerance. 4. No documentation of prednisone intolerance or malabsorption affecting steroid absorption in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**5. Patient 6, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Type 1 diabetes, insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM) as part of Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2 in medical history. 2. The summary indicates patient is on Levemir insulin at discharge (\\'Normoglycemic on Levemir insulin\\'), not Lantus. 3. No mention of insulin being changed to Lantus 15 units twice daily. 4. The only insulin related change mentioned is discontinuation of insulin drip. 5. Since the summary shows a different insulin regimen (Levemir) than the fact states (Lantus), this is a direct contradiction.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions that the patient was on \\'insulin drip\\' which was discontinued, and at discharge, the patient was \\'Normoglycemic on Levemir insulin.\\' The Important Fact states that \\'insulin changed to lantus 15units twice a day.\\' The summary does not mention Lantus insulin; instead, it mentions Levemir insulin at discharge. Lantus and Levemir are both long acting insulins but are different products. This discrepancy indicates a clear conflict between the summary and the fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states insulin changed to Lantus 15 units BID. 2. Discharge medications in Hospital Summary specify \\'Levemir insulin\\' (insulin detemir), a different basal insulin formulation. 3. No mention of Lantus initiation in any medication sections. 4. Both Lantus and Levemir are distinct long acting insulins cannot both be true simultaneously.\\n\\n\\n\\n**6. Patient 8, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Down\\'s syndrome, neurogenic bladder, admitted for pneumonia, treated with CAP regimen and vancomycin due to positive sputum culture for MRSA\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states MRSA was present in sputum culture, requiring vancomycin. 2. Summary\\'s \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\' show MRSA PCR was initially positive but later disproven. 3. Summary\\'s \\'Therapeutic Procedures\\' indicate vancomycin was discontinued after MSSA confirmation. 4. These statements directly conflict cannot have both MRSA driven vancomycin use and disproven MRSA with MSSA confirmation.\\n\\n\\n\\n**7. Patient 8, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Potential aspiration event prior to discharge, 1/4 bottles positive for GPC, speciation not complete by time of discharge\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions blood cultures drawn on 06/06/2023 as pending at discharge, but does not mention any positive blood cultures or GPC. 2. The summary does not mention any aspiration event prior to discharge. 3. While the summary describes various cultures (sputum, urine), none match the fact about 1/4 bottles being positive for GPC. 4. The clinical course described in the summary appears different from what the important fact states, suggesting these are inconsistent accounts of the same hospitalization.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'1/4 bottles positive for GPC\\' with speciation pending. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s \\'Key Diagnostic Investigations\\' lists blood cultures (06/06/2023) as \\'pending at discharge\\' with no mention of positive GPC bottles. 3. Sputum culture showed Staphylococcus aureus (GPC) but this was from respiratory samples, not blood bottles. 4. Blood culture positivity (if present) would conflict with \\'pending\\' status in summary. 5. Direct contradiction exists between reported positive bottle in fact vs pending cultures in summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**8. Patient 9, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7-day course of cipro on discharge. Started on finasteride in an attempt to prevent future UTIs. \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows patient being treated with Zosyn for Klebsiella urosepsis, while the fact states Cipro treatment 2. The summary does not mention a 7 day course of Cipro or plans to complete one 3. The summary does agree on starting finasteride for UTI prevention (mentioned in Problem #4 and Medications section) 4. The underlying diagnosis of sepsis from urinary source with pyelonephritis matches, but the antibiotic choice is different 5. This represents a clear contradiction in treatment details\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient was treated with Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) during hospitalization and was to complete the course guided by final culture sensitivities. It does not explicitly state that the patient was finishing a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin on discharge. The Important Fact mentions sepsis from urinary source with potential pyelonephritis, finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge, which contradicts the summary that implies the patient was on Zosyn. Additionally, the summary confirms that Finasteride was started for prostatomegaly, consistent with the Important Fact\\'s mention of starting Finasteride to prevent future UTIs.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states patient was \\'finishing a 7 day course of cipro on discharge.\\' 2. Hospital Summary\\'s \\'Therapeutic Procedures\\' and Problem #1 discharge plan specify Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) as the antibiotic, with no mention of ciprofloxacin. 3. These are mutually exclusive antibiotic regimens, creating a direct contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**9. Patient 12, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient sent to the hospital from home for symptoms of tachycardia, hypotension, found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula\\n\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient was sent to the hospital from home for symptoms of tachycardia and hypotension and was found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula. The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient was admitted for \\'Failure to thrive with hypotension (98/62 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR 116)\\' and mentions a \\'suspected gallbladder enteric fistula\\' based on CT findings showing \\'pneumobilia and RUQ fluid collection without visualized fistula\\'. The summary does not definitively confirm the presence of a gallbladder enteric fistula but rather labels it as \\'suspected\\' due to the lack of a visualized fistula tract on CT. The key difference lies in the certainty of the diagnosis of the gallbladder enteric fistula; the Important Fact states it as a fact, while the summary treats it as a suspicion. However, both documents agree on the presence of symptoms like tachycardia and hypotension upon admission.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states patient was \\'found to have a new gallbladder enteric fistula\\'. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s Primary Diagnosis states \\'Suspected gallbladder enteric fistula\\' with CT showing \\'RUQ fluid collection without visualized fistula tract\\'. 3. Conclusion section notes \\'definitive confirmation remains pending outpatient evaluation\\'. 4. Summary consistently uses \\'suspected\\' terminology without confirmation, directly contradicting the Important Fact\\'s definitive statement.\\n\\n\\n\\n**10. Patient 12, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** He was started on empiric antibiotics but was found to have a normal WBC with normal lactate and abx were discontinued, he was not discharged on antibiotics\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states antibiotics were started then discontinued due to normal WBC/lactate. 2. Hospital Summary Medications section (8) lists discontinued clopidogrel but no mention of antibiotics initiation or discontinuation. 3. Therapeutic Procedures (7) and Problem #1 status (\\'without active infection\\') also lack antibiotic documentation. 4. Discharge medications exclude antibiotics. This creates contradiction as the fact describes antibiotic use that isn\\'t reflected in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**11. Patient 13, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient with breast cancer admitted for bilateral mastectomy with unremarkable post operative course and discharge home \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary does not contradict the fact about breast cancer and bilateral mastectomy 2. However, the hospital course was not \\'unremarkable\\' as stated in the fact. The summary describes multiple significant issues: Hypertensive urgency with BP peaks of 202/114 mmHg Postoperative hyperglycemia requiring insulin management Supratherapeutic lidocaine levels Adhesive related skin injury Complex pain management issues 3. These complications make the course notably different from an \\'unremarkable\\' post operative course\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient was admitted for bilateral mastectomy with an unremarkable postoperative course and was discharged home. The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient underwent bilateral mastectomy for Stage IIIB inflammatory breast carcinoma. The summary also details several postoperative issues, including hypertensive urgency (BP peak 202/114 mmHg), hyperglycemia (glucose 157 231 mg/dL), adhesive related coccyx skin injury, and fluctuations in lidocaine levels. These postoperative complications contradict the statement that the patient had an \\'unremarkable postoperative course\\'. Therefore, the Hospital Course Summary is inconsistent with the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'unremarkable post operative course\\' 2. Summary documents multiple complications: hypertensive urgency (BP 202/114), supratherapeutic lidocaine levels (8.3 μg/mL), and postoperative hyperglycemia requiring insulin 3. These complications require active intervention (antihypertensive adjustment, IV medication weaning, glucose management) 4. Presence of these managed complications contradicts \\'unremarkable\\' characterization\\n\\n\\n\\n**12. Patient 13, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt has significant mental health history including anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder and did have a panic attack while admitted \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states patient \\'did have a panic attack while admitted\\'. 2. Hospital Course Summary lists mental health comorbidities (bipolar, PTSD, BPD, anxiety) in Relevant Medical History and Problem #6. 3. Problem #6 explicitly states \\'Current Status: Stable on psychotropic regimen\\' and \\'Outstanding Issues: None\\'. 4. No documentation of panic attacks in Key Investigations, Therapeutic Procedures, Medications, or Discharge Condition sections. 5. Conclusion section also lacks any mention of acute psychiatric events during admission. Conflict: Fact claims panic attack occurred during admission, but summary documents stable mental status without acute events.\\n\\n\\n\\n**13. Patient 13, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** It does not appear her chronic medical conditions including DM2 were worsened perioperatively\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary shows DM2 was worsened perioperatively: Patient had postoperative hyperglycemia with glucose levels 157 231 mg/dL Required moderate sliding scale insulin for blood glucose >200 mg/dL Listed as a secondary diagnosis: \\'Type 2 diabetes mellitus with postoperative hyperglycemia\\' Problem #3 specifically notes hyperglycemia requiring management with sliding scale insulin This directly contradicts the fact stating DM2 was not worsened perioperatively.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient\\'s chronic medical conditions, including DM2, were not worsened perioperatively. The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient had \\'Type 2 diabetes mellitus with postoperative hyperglycemia (glucose 157 231 mg/dL)\\' and required \\'moderate sliding scale insulin for blood glucose >200 mg/dL\\'. This information suggests that the patient\\'s DM2 was not well controlled postoperatively, as evidenced by hyperglycemia. Therefore, it can be inferred that DM2 management was affected perioperatively, contradicting the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states DM2 was not worsened perioperatively. 2. Summary\\'s Secondary Diagnoses lists \\'Type 2 diabetes mellitus with postoperative hyperglycemia (glucose 157 231 mg/dL)\\'. 3. Medications section shows initiation of sliding scale insulin for glucose >200 mg/dL. 4. Conclusion notes diabetes required insulin for hyperglycemia. These elements demonstrate worsened glycemic control postoperatively, contradicting the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**14. Patient 15, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The hospital course summary clearly states the primary diagnosis as \\'Acute kidney injury secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypovolemic insult\\' 2. This is documented in both Format 1 (Section 4: Primary Diagnosis) and Format 2 (Problem #1) 3. The summary consistently describes treatment for AKI and associated hypovolemia throughout 4. There is no mention of viral gastroenteritis as a diagnosis anywhere in the summary 5. While nausea/vomiting are mentioned as symptoms, they are described as contributing to hypovolemia rather than being attributed to viral gastroenteritis\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary lists \\'Acute kidney injury secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypovolemic insult\\' as the Primary Diagnosis, while the Important Fact states \\'Principal diagnosis at discharge: viral gastroenteritis.\\' The summary does not mention viral gastroenteritis as a diagnosis or a significant finding. The Reason for Admission section mentions nausea/vomiting, which could be related to viral gastroenteritis, but it is attributed to hypovolemic hypotension. The summary indicates that nausea/vomiting was resolved at discharge. The Principal Diagnosis at discharge according to the summary is related to AKI, not viral gastroenteritis, indicating a clear contradiction.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states principal diagnosis: viral gastroenteritis. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s Primary Diagnosis: AKI secondary to ATN from hypovolemia (due to nausea/vomiting). 3. Summary attributes hypovolemia to nausea/vomiting but never identifies viral gastroenteritis as the underlying cause. 4. No mention of gastroenteritis in diagnoses or conclusion. 5. Both cannot be true as principal diagnosis (viral GI vs ATN).\\n\\n\\n\\n**15. Patient 15, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Immunosuppressant medications (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) were temporarily stopped when the patient initially came to the hospital.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary mentions \\'Immunosuppression management (tacrolimus continued at 1.5 mg daily)\\' and lists tacrolimus as a continued medication. 2. The summary indicates immunosuppression was maintained, not stopped. 3. This directly contradicts the Important Fact which states immunosuppressant medications were temporarily stopped. 4. The medications section specifically states \\'Continued: Tacrolimus 1.5 mg daily\\' with no mention of temporary discontinuation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary states that \\'Immunosuppression management (tacrolimus continued at 1.5 mg daily)\\' under \\'Therapeutic Procedures Performed\\' and lists \\'Continued: Tacrolimus 1.5 mg daily\\' under \\'Medications\\'. This indicates that tacrolimus was not stopped but continued throughout the hospital stay. The Important Fact states that immunosuppressant medications, including tacrolimus, were temporarily stopped when the patient initially came to the hospital. The summary and the fact cannot both be true regarding the status of tacrolimus during the hospitalization.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, prednisone) were temporarily stopped on admission. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s \\'Therapeutic Procedures\\' section explicitly states \\'tacrolimus continued at 1.5 mg daily\\'. 3. Medications list confirms tacrolimus was continued, directly contradicting the fact. 4. No documentation of temporary cessation of tacrolimus in the summary.\\n\\n\\n\\n**16. Patient 17, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, coupled with ketosis secondary to probable starvation and alcohol use\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states hypomagnesemia. 2. Hospital Summary reports Mg²⁺ 1.8 mg/dL at discharge, within normal range (typically 1.7 2.2 mg/dL). 3. Summary lists hypokalemia but never diagnoses hypomagnesemia. 4. Normal magnesium level directly contradicts the hypomagnesemia claim.\\n\\n\\n\\n**17. Patient 18, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Persistent fever with suspected pulmonary infection despite negative infectious workups\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary contradicts the \\'persistent fever\\' claim in the Important Fact: Patient became \\'afebrile for 72 hours\\' per discharge condition Format 1 states fever was \\'resolved\\' under Problem #1 2. The summary contradicts \\'suspected pulmonary infection\\': Primary diagnosis was \\'non neutropenic fever secondary to tumor fever vs. methotrexate effect\\' Only pulmonary finding was \\'bibasilar atelectasis\\', not infection 3. The summary confirms negative infectious workups: Blood/CSF cultures were negative Procalcitonin was low at 0.09 ng/mL Empiric antibiotics were discontinued after 72 hours due to negative workup\\n\\n\\n\\n**18. Patient 18, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma recently complicated by progression to CNS lymphoma\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)\\' with CNS progression. 2. Hospital Summary specifies \\'High grade B cell lymphoma with MYC/BCL2 translocations\\' in both medical history and Problem #2. 3. High grade B cell lymphoma with MYC/BCL2 rearrangements is a distinct entity from DLBCL per WHO classification (double hit lymphoma). 4. These are mutually exclusive diagnoses, creating a direct contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**19. Patient 20, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** HHT with new PE/DVT s/p IVC filter placement as well as changed to fondaparinux\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states the patient was \\'changed to fondaparinux\\'. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s Medications section explicitly states \\'Fondaparinux (switched to apixaban per patient preference)\\'. 3. These two statements directly conflict the summary documents discontinuation of fondaparinux, not its initiation/maintenance.\\n\\n\\n\\n**20. Patient 20, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact mentions \\'worsening thrombocytopenia, s/p prednisone taper initiation\\'. The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient was initiated on prednisone 100 mg daily (under \\'Medications Initiated\\') and that thrombocytopenia improved with high dose steroids (platelets improved from 42 to 82). There is no mention of a prednisone taper initiation in the Hospital Course Summary; it only mentions initiation of prednisone. The summary indicates improvement in thrombocytopenia after prednisone initiation, contradicting the notion of \\'worsening thrombocytopenia\\' after prednisone taper initiation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'worsening thrombocytopenia\\' after prednisone taper initiation. 2. Hospital summary documents platelet improvement from 42 (05/11) to 82 (05/13) with \\'high dose steroids\\' (prednisone 100 mg daily). 3. Conclusion explicitly states \\'thrombocytopenia improved significantly...supporting ITP as primary etiology\\'. 4. These documented platelet increases directly contradict the assertion of worsening thrombocytopenia post prednisone initiation.\\n\\n\\n\\n**21. Patient 20, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge \\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states \\'monitor CBC weekly\\' under Problem #2: Thrombocytopenia discharge plan. 2. This directly contradicts the fact stating \\'Ordered twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\'. 3. Weekly monitoring is less frequent than twice weekly monitoring, making these statements incompatible.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Hospital Course Summary mentions under \\'Problem #2: Thrombocytopenia\\' that the discharge plan includes \\'monitor CBC weekly\\'. This directly supports the Important Fact that twice weekly CBCs were ordered after discharge. However, upon closer inspection, it is noted that the summary actually states \\'monitor CBC weekly\\', not \\'twice weekly\\'. This indicates a discrepancy between the stated frequency of CBC monitoring in the summary and the Important Fact.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states \\'twice weekly CBCs after discharge\\' was ordered. 2. Under Problem #2: Thrombocytopenia discharge plan, the summary specifies \\'monitor CBC weekly\\'. 3. Weekly monitoring (every 7 days) directly contradicts twice weekly monitoring (every 3 4 days). These frequencies cannot both be true.\\n\\n\\n\\n**22. Patient 21, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** T6 wedge compression fracture that likely happened before most recent fall\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the T6 wedge compression fracture likely happened before the most recent fall. The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient was admitted for \\'evaluation and management of closed wedge compression fracture of T6 vertebra secondary to recurrent falls\\'. The Primary Diagnosis section states \\'Subacute T6 wedge compression fracture secondary to recurrent falls\\', suggesting the fracture occurred due to the recent falls. These statements imply the fracture was a result of the recent falls, contradicting the Important Fact that it likely happened before the most recent fall.\\n\\n\\n\\n**23. Patient 22, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Post procedural cholangitis following recent biliary stent exchange\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states cholangitis followed \\'biliary stent exchange\\'. 2. Hospital Summary\\'s Reason for Admission specifies \\'IR biliary drain exchange\\' (12/25/2022) as the antecedent event. 3. \\'Stent\\' and \\'drain\\' refer to distinct biliary procedures (internal prosthesis vs. external drainage system). 4. Summary attributes cholangitis to drain related issues, not stent related causes as per the Fact. 5. This constitutes a direct procedural discrepancy between the two sources.\\n\\n\\n\\n**24. Patient 22, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** should continue and re-eval further continuation of augmentin therapy prior to the 14 day completion\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The hospital course summary states in Problem #3 that the patient should \\'Complete 14 day antibiotic course\\' without any mention of re evaluation. 2. The Important Fact indicates there should be a re evaluation of augmentin therapy before completing the 14 days. 3. Additionally, the summary mentions piperacillin/tazobactam as the antibiotic being used, not augmentin. 4. These represent clear contradictions in both the antibiotic choice and management plan.\\n\\n\\n\\n**25. Patient 24, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** discharged on full liquid diet and oral pain medications\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states patient was discharged on \\'oral pain medications\\'. 2. Hospital summary Medications section lists \\'Avoided: Narcotics\\' and does not mention any oral pain medications being prescribed. 3. Summary explicitly notes \\'effective non opioid pain control\\' but provides no documentation of discharge pain medication orders. 4. Absence of documented oral pain meds in discharge plan contradicts the stated fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**26. Patient 25, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Upper GI series showed no evidence for gastric outlet obstruction or significant obstruction along the duodenum. She was started on IV famotidine, later switching to PPI BID. Case was discussed with both general GI and advanced GI, who deferred EGD/ERCP and recommended empiric PPI for 8 weeks and outpatient evaluation for possible ERCP in the next few weeks.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states PPI BID was initiated after IV famotidine. 2. Hospital Summary shows PPI (pantoprazole) restarted at discharge as 40 mg daily (QD), not BID. 3. Discharge medication frequency (QD) directly conflicts with recommended BID dosing in the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**27. Patient 25, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved \\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states AKI on admission treated with fluids which resolved. 2. Hospital summary documents multiple diagnoses (malignant ascites, portal vein thrombosis) and treatments (paracentesis, enoxaparin) but never mentions AKI in admission diagnoses, hospital course, or discharge summary. 3. Resolved neutropenia and rhinovirus are explicitly noted, but no reference to AKI resolution exists. 4. Absence of AKI documentation directly conflicts with the fact\\'s assertion that it occurred and was treated.\\n\\n\\n\\n**28. Patient 26, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Metoprolol dosage increased to 75 mg twice daily for improved rate control; Apixaban dosage increased to 5 mg twice daily for anticoagulation.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary states metoprolol was titrated to 37.5 mg q6h (150 mg total daily) via tartrate dosing, not 75 mg twice daily 2. While apixaban 5 mg BID is mentioned in the summary as being \\'reinstated\\', this matches the fact\\'s statement about apixaban dosage 3. The metoprolol dosing difference represents a clear contradiction between the summary and the fact 4. The summary\\'s dosing regimen (37.5 mg q6h) and the fact\\'s regimen (75 mg BID) cannot both be true as they represent different total daily doses and administration schedules\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that Metoprolol dosage was increased to 75 mg twice daily. The Hospital Course Summary indicates that Metoprolol tartrate was intensified to 37.5 mg q6h, which translates to 150 mg daily, not 75 mg twice daily (150 mg total daily dose). 75 mg twice daily would be 150 mg total daily dose, so the total daily dose matches, but the dosing frequency differs (q6h vs. twice daily).\\n\\n\\n\\n**29. Patient 26, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient\\'s emesis may be related to chronic mesenteric ischemia, as CT angiography revealed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states emesis may relate to SMA stenosis. 2. Summary lists SMA stenosis as a secondary diagnosis but explicitly states \\'Asymptomatic after volume repletion\\' under Problem #4. 3. Summary attributes emesis resolution to IV fluids/antiemetics (Problem #2) without linking to SMA stenosis. 4. Discharge plan for SMA stenosis only mentions monitoring for future symptoms, indicating no current attribution of vomiting to this finding.\\n\\n\\n\\n**30. Patient 27, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia treated with PICC removal/replacement and antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** 1. The \\'Important Fact\\' states the patient was admitted for neutropenic fever found to have coagulase negative strep bacteremia. 2. The Hospital Course Summary indicates the patient was admitted for neutropenic fever and diagnosed with Coagulase negative Staphylococcus bacteremia (CoNS). 3. Coagulase negative Staphylococcus is not the same as coagulase negative Streptococcus; they belong to different genera. 4. The summary and fact are inconsistent because they refer to different bacteria (Staphylococcus vs. Streptococcus).\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states bacteremia was due to \\'coagulase negative strep\\' (Streptococcus). 2. Hospital Summary lists \\'Coagulase negative Staphylococcus bacteremia\\' (Staphylococcus). 3. Streptococcus and Staphylococcus are distinct bacterial genera; cannot both be true. 4. This constitutes a direct microbiological contradiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n**31. Patient 27, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary does mention tonsillar issues specifically \\'Asymmetric tonsillar enlargement (L > R) without abscess\\' in Secondary Diagnoses 2. However, the summary shows this was part of a broader infection picture including CoNS bacteremia and was treated primarily with vancomycin/linezolid, not standard tonsillitis antibiotics 3. The tonsillar finding was incidental to the main diagnosis and treatment course, which focused on neutropenic fever and bacteremia 4. While there was tonsillar enlargement, the clinical picture and treatment described in the summary does not align with typical tonsillitis management 5. The fact states tonsillitis was diagnosed and treated, which contradicts the actual clinical course described in the summary\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important fact states \\'imaging and localizing sx suggestive of tonsilitis, treated with antibiotics\\'. 2. Hospital summary documents \\'asymmetric tonsillar enlargement (L > R) without abscess\\' (imaging finding) under Secondary Diagnoses. 3. Antibiotics listed (vancomycin, linezolid) are appropriate for bacteremia (Primary Diagnosis: CoNS) but not targeted at tonsillar pathology. 4. No documentation of tonsillitis diagnosis or antibiotic selection specifically for tonsillar infection. 5. Oropharyngeal management focused on antifungals (fluconazole/nystatin) for thrush, not bacterial tonsillitis. 6. Summary treats tonsillar enlargement as anatomical finding rather than infectious tonsillitis.\\n\\n\\n\\n**32. Patient 28, Fact 0:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Pt admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that the patient was admitted for recurrent malignant biliary obstruction with hyperbilirubinemia requiring PTBD exchange on 4/21/23. The Hospital Course Summary indicates that the patient had a PTBD exchange, with the most recent exchange mentioned being on 04/08. It also mentions that the patient was admitted for biliary drain optimization following PTBD exchange, which aligns with the reason for admission being related to PTBD exchange. However, the date of the PTBD exchange in the summary (04/08) does not match the date in the Important Fact (4/21/23). This discrepancy in dates (04/08 vs 4/21/23) for the PTBD exchange indicates a contradiction between the Hospital Course Summary and the Important Fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n**33. Patient 28, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\n\\n- **Explanation from claude-3.5-sonnet-v2:** 1. The summary directly contradicts the fact about bilirubin not improving: Summary states \\'bilirubin decreased to 10.8 mg/dL\\' and mentions \\'subsequent bilirubin reduction\\' The Important Fact states \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange\\' 2. While both mention transition to hospice, they present opposing outcomes of the PTBD intervention\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that \\'Bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange, and pt/family opted to transition to home hospice.\\' The Hospital Course Summary under \\'Problem #1: Malignant Biliary Obstruction with Cholangitis\\' states that \\'Improved drainage with 16 Fr PTBD, bilirubin decreased to 10.8 mg/dL\\', indicating an improvement in bilirubin levels after PTBD exchange. This directly contradicts the Important Fact, which claims that bilirubin did not improve despite PTBD exchange.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states bilirubin did not improve post PTBD exchange. 2. Hospital Summary (Problem #1) reports \\'bilirubin decreased to 10.8 mg/dL\\' following PTBD exchanges. 3. Peak bilirubin was 17.6 mg/dL, showing improvement. 4. Direct contradiction between \\'did not improve\\' (fact) vs. \\'decrease\\' (summary).\\n\\n\\n\\n**34. Patient 28, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Hospital course complicated by sepsis requiring antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, delirium requiring pharmacotherapy, and urinary retention requiring urinary catheter.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states urinary retention requiring catheter, but summary never mentions urinary retention or catheter use. 2. Sepsis management with antibiotics is not documented in summary\\'s infection management or medications. 3. Delirium pharmacotherapy (lorazepam PRN) is consistent with fact. Contradiction exists for 2/3 components.\\n\\n\\n\\n**35. Patient 29, Fact 1:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Management of pt\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma deferred to outpt oncologist per patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and patient\\'s delirium.\\n\\n- **Explanation from llama4-maverick:** The Important Fact states that management of the patient\\'s metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma was deferred to an outpatient oncologist per the patient\\'s son\\'s wishes and the patient\\'s delirium. The Hospital Course Summary mentions \\'Expedited radiation oncology consultation\\' under Problem #1: T4 Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma, indicating that the management of the carcinoma was not entirely deferred. The presence of \\'Treatment plan pending mental capacity evaluation\\' suggests that there were plans to address the carcinoma, contradicting the statement that management was deferred.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states management was deferred due to patient\\'s delirium and son\\'s wishes. 2. Summary notes delirium resolved by discharge (Secondary Diagnoses). 3. Summary\\'s Problem #1 lists \\'Expedited radiation oncology consultation\\' as discharge plan, indicating active planning rather than deferral. 4. No mention of deferral to outpatient team based on family wishes in summary. 5. Contradiction exists between resolved delirium in summary vs. Important Fact citing delirium as reason for deferral.\\n\\n\\n\\n**36. Patient 29, Fact 2:**\\n\\n- **Fact:** Patient developed temporary O2 requirement felt to be result of aspiration pneumonitis, made strict NPO by SLP.\\n\\n- **Explanation from deepseek-r1:** 1. Important Fact states patient had temporary O2 requirement due to aspiration pneumonitis and was made NPO by SLP. 2. Hospital Summary (Problem #3) lists \\'Strict NPO\\' for dysphagia/aspiration risk but never mentions aspiration pneumonitis or any O2 requirement. 3. No documentation of respiratory complications, oxygen therapy, or pneumonitis diagnosis in any section. 4. Summary attributes NPO status to dysphagia from nasopharyngeal carcinoma, conflicting with the Fact\\'s stated cause (pneumonitis).\\n\\n\\n'}"
